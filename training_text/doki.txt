Sayori: "Heeeeeeeyyy!!"
*I see an annoying girl running toward me from the distance, waving her arms in the air like she's totally oblivious to any attention she might draw to herself.*
*That girl is Sayori, my neighbor and good friend since we were children.*
*You know, the kind of friend you'd never see yourself making today, but it just kind of works out because you've known each other for so long?*
*We used to walk to school together on days like this, but starting around high school she would oversleep more and more frequently, and I would get tired of waiting up.*
*But if she's going to chase after me like this, I almost feel better off running away.*
*However, I just sigh and idle in front of the crosswalk and let Sayori catch up to me.*
Sayori: "I overslept again!"
Sayori: "But I caught you this time!"
<USER>: "Maybe, but only because I decided to stop and wait for you."
Sayori: "That's mean, <USER>!"
<USER>: "Well, if people stare at you for acting weird then I don't want them to think we're a couple or something."
Sayori: "But you did wait for me, after all."
Sayori: "I guess you don't have it in you to be mean even if you want to~"
<USER>: "Whatever you say, Sayori..."
*We cross the street together and make our way to school.*
*As we draw near, the streets become increasingly speckled with other students making their daily commute.*
Sayori: "By the way, <USER>..."
Sayori: "Have you decided on a club to join yet?"
<USER>: "A club?"
<USER>: "I told you already, I'm really not interested in joining any clubs."
<USER>: "I haven't been looking, either."
Sayori: "You told me you would join a club this year!"
<USER>: "Did I...?"
*I'm sure it's possible that I did, in one of our many conversations where I dismissively go along with whatever she's going on about.*
*Sayori likes to worry a little too much about me, when I'm perfectly content just getting by on the average while spending my free time on games and anime.*
Sayori: "I was talking about how I'm worried that you won't learn how to socialize or have any skills before college."
Sayori: "Your happiness is really important to me, you know!"
Sayori: "And I know you're happy now, but I'd die at the thought of you becoming a NEET in a few years because you're not used to the real world!"
Sayori: "Don't make me keep worrying about you..."
<USER>: "Alright, alright..."
<USER>: "I'll look at a few clubs if it makes you happy."
<USER>: "No promises, though."
<USER>: "Yeah, I guess I'll promise you that."
*Why do I let myself get lectured by such a carefree girl?*
*More than that, I'm surprised I even let myself relent to her.*
*I guess seeing her worry so much about me makes me want to ease her mind at least a little bit - even if she does exaggerate everything inside of her head.*
*The school day is as ordinary as ever, and it's over before I know it.*
*After I pack up my things, I stare blankly at the wall, looking for an ounce of motivation.*
<USER>: "Clubs..."
*Sayori wants me to check out some clubs.*
*I guess I have no choice but to start with the anime club...*
Sayori: "Hellooo?"
<USER>: "Sayori...?"
*Sayori must have come into the classroom while I was spacing out.*
*I look around and realize that I'm the only one left in the classroom.*
Sayori: "Honestly, you're even worse than me sometimes... I'm impressed!"
<USER>: "<USER> don't need to wait up for me if it's going to make you late to your own club."
<USER>: "Know what?"
<USER>: "Sayori..."
<USER>: "...There is no way I'm going to your club."
*Sayori is vice president of the Literature Club.*
*Not that I was ever aware that she had any interest in literature.*
*In fact, I'm 99%% sure she only did it because she thought it would be fun to help start a new club.*
*Since she was the first one to show interest after the one who proposed the club, she inherited the title \*Vice President\*.*
*That said, my interest in literature is guaranteed to be even less.*
<USER>: "Yeah. I'm going to the anime club."
<USER>: "Why do you care so much, anyway?"
Sayori: "I kind of told the club yesterday I would bring in a new member..."
Sayori: "And Natsuki made cupcakes and everything..."
Sayori: "Ehehe..."
<USER>: "Don't make promises you can't keep!"
*I can't tell if Sayori is really that much of an airhead, or if she's so cunning as to have planned all of this out.*
*I let out a long sigh.*
<USER>: "Fine... I'll stop by for a cupcake, okay?"
*And thus, today marks the day I sold my soul for a cupcake.*
*I dejectedly follow Sayori across the school and upstairs - a section of the school I rarely visit, being generally used for third-year classes and activities.*
*Sayori, full of energy, swings open the classroom door.*
Sayori: "Everyone! The new member is here~!"
<USER>: "I told you, don't call me a 'new member--'"
*Eh? I glance around the room.*
Yuri: "Welcome to the Literature Club. It's a pleasure meeting you."
Yuri: "Sayori always says nice things about you."
Natsuki: "Seriously? You brought a boy?"
Natsuki: "Way to kill the atmosphere."
Monika: "Ah, <USER>! What a nice surprise!"
Monika: "Welcome to the club!"
<USER>: "..."
*All words escape me in this situation.*
*This club...*
*{i}...is full of incredibly cute girls!!{/i}*
Natsuki: "If you want to say something, say it."
<USER>: "S-Sorry..."
Yuri: "Natsuki..."
*The girl with the sour attitude, whose name is apparently Natsuki, is one I don't recognize.*
*Her small figure makes me think she's probably a first-year.*
*She is also the one who made cupcakes, according to Sayori.*
Sayori: "You can just ignore her when she gets moody~"
*Sayori says that quietly into my ear, then turns back toward the other girls.*
Sayori: "And this is Yuri, the smartest in the club!"
*Yuri, who appears comparably more mature and timid, seems to have a hard time keeping up with people like Sayori and Natsuki.*
<USER>: "Ah... Well, it's nice to meet both of you."
Monika: "That's right."
Monika: "It's great to see you again, <USER>."
*Monika smiles sweetly.*
*We do know each other - well, we rarely talked, but we were in the same class last year.*
*Monika was probably the most popular girl in class - smart, beautiful, athletic.*
*Basically, completely out of my league.*
*So, having her smile at me so genuinely feels a little...*
<USER>: "Y-<USER> too, Monika."
Sayori: "I'll get the cupcakes~"
Natsuki: "Hey! I made them, I'll get them!"
Yuri: "Then, how about I make some tea as well?"
*The girls have a few desks arranged to form a table.*
*As Sayori mentioned, it's been widened so that there is one space next to Monika and one space next to Sayori.*
*Natsuki and Yuri walk over to the corner of the room, where Natsuki grabs a wrapped tray and Yuri opens the closet.*
*Still feeling awkward, I take a seat next to Sayori.*
*Natsuki proudly marches back to the table, tray in hand.*
Natsuki: "Okaaay, are you ready?"
Natsuki: "...Ta-daa!"
Sayori: "Uwooooah!"
*Natsuki lifts the foil off the tray to reveal a dozen white, fluffy cupcakes decorated to look like little cats.*
*The whiskers are drawn with icing, and little pieces of chocolate were used to make ears.*
Natsuki: "Just hurry and take one!"
*Sayori grabs one first, then Monika. I follow.*
*Sayori talks with her mouth full and has already managed to get icing on her face.*
*I turn the cupcake around in my fingers, looking for the best angle to take a bite.*
*Natsuki is quiet.*
*I can't help but notice her sneaking glances in my direction.*
*Is she waiting for me to take a bite?*
*I finally bite down.*
*The icing is sweet and full of flavor - I wonder if she made it herself.*
<USER>: "This is really good."
<USER>: "Thank you, Natsuki."
*{i}(Haven't I heard this somewhere before...?){/i}*
<USER>: "Eh? I thought you technically did. Sayori said--"
Natsuki: "But not for, y-you know, {i}you!{/i} Dummy..."
<USER>: "Alright, alright..."
*I give up on Natsuki's weird logic and dismiss the conversation.*
*Yuri returns to the table, carrying a tea set.*
*She carefully places a teacup in front of each of us before setting down the teapot next to the cupcake tray.*
<USER>: "<USER> keep a whole tea set in this classroom?"
Yuri: "Don't worry, the teachers gave us permission."
Yuri: "After all, doesn't a hot cup of tea help you enjoy a good book?"
<USER>: "Ah... I-I guess..."
Monika: "Ehehe, don't let yourself get intimidated, Yuri's just trying to impress you."
*Insulted, Yuri looks away.*
<USER>: "I believe you."
<USER>: "Well, tea and reading might not be a pastime for me, but I at least enjoy tea."
*Yuri faintly smiles to herself in relief.*
*Monika raises an eyebrow, then smiles at me.*
<USER>: "Um..."
*I was afraid of this question.*
*Something tells me I shouldn't tell Monika that I was practically dragged here by Sayori.*
<USER>: "Well, I haven't joined any clubs yet, and Sayori seemed really happy here, so..."
Monika: "As president of the Literature Club, it's my duty to make the club fun and exciting for everyone!"
<USER>: "Monika, I'm surprised."
<USER>: "How come you decided to start your own club?"
<USER>: "<USER> could probably be a board member for any of the major clubs."
<USER>: "Weren't you a leader of the debate club last year?"
Monika: "To be honest, I can't stand all of the politics around the major clubs."
Monika: "It feels like nothing but arguing about the budget and publicity and how to prepare for events..."
Monika: "I'd much rather take something I personally enjoy and make something special out of it."
Sayori: "Monika really is a great leader!"
*Yuri also nods in agreement.*
<USER>: "Then I'm surprised there aren't more people in the club yet."
<USER>: "It must be hard to start a new club."
Monika: "Not many people are very interested in putting out all the effort to start something brand new..."
Monika: "Especially when it's something that doesn't grab your attention, like literature."
Monika: "You have to work hard to convince people that you're both fun and worthwhile."
Monika: "But it makes school events, like the festival, that much more important."
Monika: "Right, everyone?"
Sayori: "Yeah!"
Yuri: "We'll do our best."
Natsuki: "You know it!"
*Everyone enthusiastically agrees.*
*Such different girls, all interested in the same goal...*
*Monika must have worked really hard just to find these three.*
*Maybe that's why they were all so delighted by the idea of a new member joining.*
*Though I still don't really know if I can keep up with their level of enthusiasm about literature...*
Yuri: "So, <USER>, what kinds of things do you like to read?"
<USER>: "Well... Ah..."
*Considering how little I've read these past few years, I don't really have a good way of answering that.*
<USER>: "...Manga..."
*I mutter quietly to myself, half-joking.*
*Natsuki's head suddenly perks up.*
*It looks like she wants to say something, but she keeps quiet.*
<USER>: "...Well, that can change..."
*What am I saying?*
*I spoke without thinking after seeing Yuri's sad smile.*
<USER>: "Anyway, what about you, Yuri?"
*Yuri traces the rim of her teacup with her finger.*
Yuri: "The level of creativity and craftsmanship behind them is amazing to me."
*Yuri goes on, clearly passionate about her reading.*
*She seemed so reserved and timid since the moment I walked in, but it's obvious by the way her eyes light up that she finds her comfort in the world of books, not people.*
Yuri: "Stories with deep psychological elements usually immerse me as well."
Yuri: "Anyway, I've been reading a lot of horror lately..."
<USER>: "Ah, I read a horror book once..."
*I desperately grasp something I can relate to at the minimal level.*
*At this rate, Yuri might as well be having a conversation with a rock.*
Monika: "Really? I wouldn't have expected that, Yuri."
Monika: "For someone as gentle as you..."
Yuri: "But if a story makes me think, or takes me to another world, then I really can't put it down."
Yuri: "Surreal horror is often very successful at changing the way you look at the world, if only for a brief moment."
Natsuki: "Ugh, I hate horror..."
*Natsuki's eyes dart over to me for a split second.*
Natsuki: "W-What?"
Natsuki: "What gives you that idea?"
Monika: "It looked like you were working on a poem called--"
Natsuki: "Don't say it out loud!!"
Natsuki: "And give that back!"
Sayori: "Ehehe, your cupcakes, your poems..."
Sayori: "Everything you do is just as cute as you are~"
*Sayori sidles up behind Natsuki and puts her hands on her shoulders.*
<USER>: "Natsuki, you write your own poems?"
Natsuki: "Why do you care?"
<USER>: "I think that's impressive."
<USER>: "Why don't you share them sometime?"
*Natsuki averts her eyes.*
Natsuki: "You wouldn't...like them..."
<USER>: "Ah...not a very confident writer yet?"
Yuri: "I understand how Natsuki feels."
Yuri: "Sharing that level of writing takes more than just confidence."
Yuri: "You must be willing to open up to your readers, exposing your vulnerabilities and showing even the deepest reaches of your heart."
Monika: "Do you have writing experience too, Yuri?"
Monika: "Maybe if you share some of your work, you can set an example and help Natsuki feel comfortable enough to share hers."
<USER>: "I guess it's the same for Yuri..."
Sayori: "Aww... I wanted to read everyone's poems..."
*We all sit in silence for a moment.*
Monika: "Okay!"
Monika: "I have an idea, everyone~"
*Natsuki and Yuri look quizzically at Monika.*
Monika: "Then, next time we meet, we'll all share them with each other."
Monika: "That way, everyone is even!"
Yuri: "..."
Sayori: "Yeaaah! Let's do it!"
Monika: "Isn't that right, <USER>?"
*Monika smiles warmly at me once again.*
<USER>: "Hold on...there's still one problem."
*Now that we're back to the original topic of me joining the club, I bluntly come forth with what's been on my mind the entire time.*
<USER>: "I never said I would join this club!"
<USER>: "Sayori may have convinced me to stop by, but I never made any decision."
<USER>: "I still have other clubs to look at, and...um..."
*I lose my train of thought.*
*All four girls stare back at me with dejected eyes.*
<USER>: "Y-<USER> all..."
*I...I'm defenseless against these girls.*
*How am I supposed to make a clear-headed decision when it's like this?*
*That is, if writing poems is the price I need to pay in order to spend every day with these beautiful girls...*
<USER>: "...Right."
<USER>: "Okay, I've decided, then."
<USER>: "I'll join the Literature Club."
*One by one, the girls' eyes light up.*
*Sayori wraps her arms around me, jumping up and down.*
<USER>: "H-Hey--"
Monika: "Welcome to the Literature Club!"
<USER>: "Ah...thanks, I guess."
Monika: "I think with that, we can officially end today's meeting on a good note."
Monika: "Everyone remember tonight's assignment"
Monika: "Write a poem to bring to the next meeting, so we can all share!"
*Monika looks over at me once more.*
Monika: "Ehehe~"
<USER>: "Y-Yeah..."
*Can I really impress the class star Monika with my mediocre writing skills?*
*I already feel the anxiety welling up inside me.*
*Meanwhile, the girls continue to chit-chat as Yuri and Natsuki clean up their food.*
Sayori: "Hey, <USER>, since we're already here, do you want to walk home together?"
*That's right - Sayori and I never walk home together anymore because she always stayed after school for clubs.*
<USER>: "Sure, might as well."
*With that, the two of us depart the clubroom and make our way home.*
*The whole way, my mind wanders back and forth between the four girls*
*Sayori,*
*Natsuki,*
*Yuri,*
*and, of course, Monika.*
*Will I really be happy spending every day after school in a literature club?*
*Perhaps I'll have the chance to grow closer to one of these girls...*
*Alright!*
*I'll just need to make the most of my circumstances, and I'm sure good fortune will find me.*
*And I guess that starts with writing a poem tonight...*
Sayori: "..."
Sayori: "..."
Sayori: "W-What..."
Sayori: "This..."
Sayori: "What is this...?"
Sayori: "Oh no..."
Sayori: "This can't be it."
Sayori: "This can't be all there is."
Sayori: "What am I?"
Sayori: "Make it stop!"
Sayori: "PLEASE MAKE IT STOP!"
Monika: "Hi again, <USER>!"
Monika: "Glad to see you didn't run away on us. Hahaha!"
<USER>: "Nah, don't worry."
<USER>: "This might be a little strange for me, but I at least keep my word."
*Well, I'm back at the Literature Club.*
*I was the last to come in, so everyone else is already hanging out.*
Yuri: "Thanks for keeping your promise, <USER>."
Yuri: "I hope this isn't too overwhelming of a commitment for you."
Natsuki: "Oh, come on! Like he deserves any slack."
Natsuki: "Sayori told me you didn't even want to join any clubs this year."
Natsuki: "And last year, too!"
Natsuki: "But if you don't take us seriously, then you won't see the end of it."
Monika: "Natsuki, you certainly have a big mouth for someone who keeps her manga collection in the clubroom."
*Natsuki finds herself stuck between saying \*Monika\* and \*Manga\*.*
*Swiftly defeated, Natsuki plops back into her seat.*
Sayori: "Don't worry, guys~"
Sayori: "<USER> always gives it his best as long as he's having fun."
Sayori: "He helps me with busywork without me even asking."
Sayori: "Like cooking, cleaning my room..."
<USER>: "Sayori, that's because your room is so messy it's distracting."
<USER>: "And you almost set your house on fire once."
Yuri: "I might be a little jealous..."
<USER>: "S-Sayori--"
Sayori: "Hmm?"
<USER>: "..."
*As usual, Sayori seems oblivious to the weird situation she just put me into.*
<USER>: "Eh? Me?"
Yuri: "It's really nothing..."
<USER>: "What is it?"
Yuri: "Sayori made it sound like a big deal when it's really not..."
Yuri: "Uuuuh, what do I do..."
*I guess that means it's up to me to rescue this situation...*
<USER>: "Hey, don't worry about it."
<USER>: "First of all, I wasn't expecting anything in the first place."
<USER>: "So any nice gesture from you is a pleasant surprise."
<USER>: "It'll make me happy no matter what."
<USER>: "Yeah. I won't make it a big deal if you don't want it to be."
Yuri: "Alright..."
*Yuri reaches into her bag and pulls out a book.*
Yuri: "I didn't want you to feel left out..."
Yuri: "So I picked out a book that I thought you might enjoy."
Yuri: "It's a short read, so it should keep your attention, even if you don't usually read."
Yuri: "And we could, you know..."
*Th-This is...*
*How is this girl accidentally being so cute?*
*She even picked out a book she thinks I'll like, despite me not reading much...*
<USER>: "Yuri, thank you! I'll definitely read this!"
*I enthusiastically take the book.*
Yuri: "Phew..."
Yuri: "I look forward to hearing what you think."
*Now that everyone's settled in, I expected Monika to kick off some scheduled activities for the club.*
*But that doesn't seem to be the case.*
*Sayori and Monika are having a cheery conversation in the corner.*
*Yuri's face is already buried in a book.*
*I can't help but notice her intense expression, like she was waiting for this chance.*
*Meanwhile, Natsuki is rummaging around in the closet.*
Monika: "By the way, did you remember to write a poem last night?"
<USER>: "Y-Yeah..."
*My relaxation ends.*
*I can't believe I agreed to do something so embarrassing.*
*I couldn't really find much inspiration, since I've never really done this before.*
Monika: "Well, now that everyone's ready, why don't you find someone to share with?"
Sayori: "I can't wait~!"
*Sayori and Monika enthusiastically pull out their poems.*
*Sayori's is on a wrinkled sheet of loose leaf torn from a spiral notebook.*
*On the other hand, Monika wrote hers in a composition notebook.*
*I can already see Monika's pristine handwriting from where I sit.*
*Natsuki and Yuri reluctantly comply as well, reaching into their bags.*
*I do the same, myself.*
<USER>: "Phew..."
*I guess that's everyone.*
*I glance around the room.*
*That was a little more stressful than I anticipated.*
*It's as if everyone is judging me for my mediocre writing abilities...*
*Even if they're just being nice, there's no way my poems can stand up to theirs.*
*This is a literature club, after all.*
*I sigh.*
*I guess that's what I ended up getting myself into.*
*Across the room, Sayori and Monika are happily chatting.*
*My eyes land on Yuri and Natsuki.*
*They gingerly exchange sheets of paper, sharing their respective poems.*
*As they read in tandem, I watch each of their expressions change.*
*Natsuki's eyebrows furrow in frustration.*
*Meanwhile, Yuri smiles sadly.*
Yuri: "Um...did you say something?"
*Natsuki dismissively returns the poem to the desk with one hand.*
Natsuki: "I guess you could say it's fancy."
Yuri: "Yours is...cute..."
Natsuki: "It's clearly about the feeling of giving up."
Natsuki: "How can that be cute?"
Yuri: "I just meant..."
Yuri: "I was trying to say something nice..."
Natsuki: "Eh?"
Natsuki: "Thanks, but it really didn't come out nice at all!"
Yuri: "Well, I do have a couple suggestions..."
Natsuki: "If I was looking for suggestions, I would have asked someone who actually liked it."
Natsuki: "Which people {i}did{/i}, by the way."
Natsuki: "And <USER> did, too!"
Natsuki: "So based on that, I'll gladly give you some suggestions of my own."
Natsuki: "First of all--"
Yuri: "I appreciate the offer, but I've spent a long time establishing my writing style."
Yuri: "Which I haven't yet."
Yuri: "He even told me he was impressed by it."
*Natsuki suddenly stands up.*
Natsuki: "I didn't realize you were so invested in trying to impress our new member, Yuri."
Yuri: "That's not what I...!"
Yuri: "You...You're just..."
*Yuri stands up as well.*
Natsuki: "Are you that full of yourself?"
Yuri: "No..."
Yuri: "If I was full of myself..."
Sayori: "U-Um!!"
Sayori: "Is everyone okay...?"
Natsuki: "I wasn't the one whose boobs magically grew a size bigger as soon as <USER> started showing up!!"
Yuri: "N-Natsuki!!"
Monika: "Um, Natsuki, that's a little--"
Sayori: "I-I don't like fighting, guys...!"
*Suddenly, both girls turn towards me, as if they just noticed I was standing there.*
Yuri: "She-- She's just trying to make me look bad...!"
Natsuki: "She started it!"
Natsuki: "Then this wouldn't have happened in the first place!"
Natsuki: "What's the point in making your poems all convoluted for no reason?"
Natsuki: "The meaning should jump out at the reader, not force them to have to figure it out."
Yuri: "There's a reason we have so many deep and expressive words in our language!"
Yuri: "Avoiding them is not only unnecessarily limiting yourself...it's also a waste!"
<USER>: "Um...!"
<USER>: "..."
*How did I get dragged into this in the first place?!*
*It's not like I know anything about writing...*
*But whomever I agree with, they'll probably think more highly of me!*
Monika: "Okay, everyone!"
Monika: "It's just about time for us to leave."
Monika: "How did you all feel about sharing poems?"
Sayori: "It was a lot of fun!"
Yuri: "Well, I'd say it was worth it."
Natsuki: "It was alright. Well, mostly."
<USER>: "...Yeah, I'd say the same."
<USER>: "It was a neat thing to talk about with everyone."
Monika: "And maybe you learned something from your friends, too."
<USER>: "..."
*I think to myself.*
*I did learn a little more about the kinds of poems everyone likes.*
*With any luck, that means I can at least do a better job impressing those I want to impress.*
*I nod to myself with newfound determination.*
Sayori: "<USER>!"
Sayori: "Ready to walk home?"
<USER>: "Sure, let's go."
*Sayori beams at me.*
*It truly has been a while since Sayori and I have spent this much time together.*
*I can't really say I'm not enjoying it, either.*
<USER>: "Sayori..."
<USER>: "About what happened earlier..."
<USER>: "<USER> know, between Yuri and Natsuki."
<USER>: "Does that kind of thing happen often?"
Sayori: "That's really the first time I've seen them fight like that..."
Sayori: "I promise they're both wonderful people."
<USER>: "No, I don't hate them!"
<USER>: "I just wanted your opinion, that's all."
<USER>: "I can see why they'd make good friends with you."
Sayori: "You know, <USER>..."
Sayori: "It's nice that I get to spend time with you in the club."
Sayori: "But I think seeing you get along with everyone is what makes me the happiest."
<USER>: "That's--!"
Sayori: "Every day is going to be so much fun~"
<USER>: "Sigh..."
*It looks like Sayori still hasn't caught onto the kind of situation I'm in.*
*Sure, being friends with everyone is nice, but...*
*...Does it really need to stop there?*
<USER>: "We'll just have to see what the future holds, Sayori."
*I pat Sayori on the shoulder.*
*I said that more to myself than to her, but it's easy to use Sayori as an internal monologue sometimes.*
*Yeah...*
*Let's do this!*
<USER>: "Um..."
<USER>: "Yuri!"
<USER>: "<USER>'re really talented."
Yuri: "Eh? W-Well..."
<USER>: "But Natsuki has a point!"
<USER>: "I think that..."
*I wrack my brain in an attempt to back myself up.*
<USER>: "I think that conveying feelings with few words..."
<USER>: "Can be just as impressive as well!"
<USER>: "It lets the reader's imagination take over."
<USER>: "And Natsuki's poem did a really good job at that!"
Natsuki: "It did, didn't it?!"
Natsuki: "Ahah!"
Natsuki: "Shows how much {i}you{/i} know!"
<USER>: "Natsuki..."
<USER>: "I think that's enough."
Natsuki: "Me?"
Natsuki: "But she was so mean to me...!"
*Natsuki's voice whines.*
<USER>: "Look..."
<USER>: "What we talked about yesterday was right."
<USER>: "Writing is a really personal thing."
<USER>: "And sharing it can definitely be hard."
<USER>: "It looks like we learned that today."
<USER>: "Even small criticism can lead to something pretty heated."
*I glance over my shoulder.*
*Sayori is nodding vigorously.*
<USER>: "Yeah, so..."
<USER>: "<USER> don't need to feel threatened."
<USER>: "<USER>'re a great writer, Natsuki."
*Natsuki's voice gets caught in surprise.*
*She finally mutters that, barely audible.*
<USER>: "Yuri..."
*Yuri looks at me dejectedly.*
*With a face like that, I can't help but feel bad for her as well.*
<USER>: "I'm sure that Natsuki didn't mean everything she said."
<USER>: "So you don't need to feel threatened, either."
Yuri: "If you say so..."
Natsuki: "It's not like you need to apologize {i}for{/i} me, <USER>."
*Natsuki takes a breath.*
Natsuki: "The thing about..."
Natsuki: "Uu..."
*Natsuki glances around the room.*
*Unsurprisingly, Natsuki has a harder time with it than she boasted.*
*Sayori and Monika look away.*
Natsuki: "Anyway...!"
Natsuki: "That's all."
*Natsuki looks away, avoiding eye contact with anyone.*
Sayori: "Yeah! You're naturally beautiful, Yuri!!"
<USER>: "Sayori?!"
Yuri: "..."
Yuri: "I-I'll go make some tea..."
Sayori: "I was just trying to help!"
<USER>: "I'm sure she appreciated it, Sayori."
*I pat Sayori on the shoulder.*
Monika: "Well, now that we're past that..."
Monika: "I hope that it was worthwhile for everyone!"
Monika: "And to be honest..."
Monika: "It's a nice change of pace from the lazing around we got a little too used to."
Monika: "Ahahaha!"
<USER>: "Ah, so my joining the club was responsible for ruining the atmosphere..."
Monika: "There's still time before we go home."
Monika: "Of course, besides chatting, we do literature-related things in the clubroom..."
Monika: "So maybe you can take the chance to pick up a book, or do some writing."
Sayori: "I disagree, Monika!"
Sayori: "The most important thing..."
Sayori: "Is having fun!"
*In the end, though, Monika's right.*
*Being in the Literature Club probably means I can't spend all my time doing nothing.*
*But in the end...*
*...I guess it's been worth it so far.*
<USER>: "Natsuki."
<USER>: "<USER>'re right that I liked your poem."
<USER>: "Wait!"
<USER>: "That's not an excuse for you to be so mean!"
<USER>: "<USER> shouldn't pick a fight just because someone's opinion is different."
Natsuki: "Yuri wouldn't even take my poem seriously!"
<USER>: "Mm..."
<USER>: "I understand."
<USER>: "Yuri."
<USER>: "<USER>'re a seriously talented writer."
<USER>: "It's no secret that I was impressed."
<USER>: "But here's the thing."
<USER>: "No matter how simple or refined someone's writing style is..."
<USER>: "They're still putting feelings into it, and it becomes something really personal."
<USER>: "That's why Natsuki felt threatened when you said her poem was cute."
Yuri: "I didn't notice that I..."
Yuri: "Uuu..."
<USER>: "But Natsuki, you took it way too far!"
<USER>: "Yuri means well, and if you just told her how you felt..."
<USER>: "Then this wouldn't have happened in the first place."
Natsuki: "That's exactly what I did!"
Natsuki: "It was {i}her{/i} that--"
Monika: "Natsuki, I think that's enough."
Monika: "You both said some things that you didn't mean."
Monika: "Yuri apologized. Don't you think you should, too?"
*Natsuki clenches her fists.*
*In the end, nobody has taken her side.*
*She's trapped, at this point being defiant only because she can't handle the pressure.*
*I end up even feeling bad for her.*
Sayori: "U-Um!"
Sayori: "Sometimes when I'm hurt..."
Sayori: "It helps to take a walk and clear my head!"
<USER>: "Sayori, she doesn't need to--"
Natsuki: "I'm going to do that."
*Without warning, Natsuki snatches her own poem up from the desk and storms out.*
*On her way out, she crumples up the poem with her hands and throws it in the trash.*
*I look across the room.*
*Yuri has her chin buried in her hands while she stares down at her desk.*
*I gingerly approach her and sit in an adjacent chair.*
Yuri: "Sigh..."
<USER>: "Everything alright?"
Yuri: "I'm so embarrassed..."
Yuri: "I can't believe I acted like that."
Yuri: "You probably hate me now..."
<USER>: "No--Yuri!"
<USER>: "How could anyone not have gotten frustrated after being treated like that?"
<USER>: "<USER> handled it as well as anyone could."
<USER>: "I don't think any less of you."
Yuri: "...Alright, I believe you."
Yuri: "I'm thankful to have you a part of this club now."
<USER>: "Er-- It's nothing."
Yuri: "Um, that one thing that Natsuki said..."
Yuri: "I would never do anything...so shameful..."
Yuri: "So..."
<USER>: "...Eh?"
<USER>: "What thing did Natsuki say?"
Yuri: "U-Um!"
Yuri: "I-I'm going to go make some tea..."
<USER>: "Ah, good idea."
<USER>: "Make enough for more than one person, okay?"
Yuri: "Y-Yeah."
<USER>: "N-Natsuki..."
*Natsuki glares at me, drying up any words I had in my mouth.*
*So instead, I turn to Yuri.*
<USER>: "Yuri..."
*But Yuri's expression is so defenseless that I can't bring myself to say anything to her.*
<USER>: "..."
<USER>: "...Sayori!"
Sayori: "Eh?!"
<USER>: "...Yeah!"
<USER>: "Everyone's fighting is making Sayori uncomfortable."
<USER>: "How can the two of you keep fighting when you know you're making your friend feel like this?"
Natsuki: "Well... That's her problem! This isn't about her."
Yuri: "I-I agree..."
Yuri: "It's unfair for others to interject their own feelings into our conflict."
Yuri: "She would never...!"
Yuri: "It's your immaturity that's made her upset in the first place!"
Natsuki: "{i}Excuse{/i} me?"
Natsuki: "Are you listening to yourself?"
Sayori: "{i}Stop!!{/i}"
Sayori: "You guys are my friends!"
Sayori: "My friends are wonderful people..."
Sayori: "And I love them because of their differences!"
Sayori: "They're amazing because they give you so many feelings with just a few words!"
Sayori: "And Yuri's poems are amazing because they paint beautiful pictures in your head!"
Sayori: "...So why are we fighting...?"
Yuri: "Well..."
Sayori: "Natsuki's cute and there's nothing wrong with that!"
<USER>: "Sayori..."
*Sayori stands triumphantly.*
*Monika stands behind her with a bewildered expression.*
*Yuri rushes off.*
*Natsuki sits down with a blank expression on her face, staring at nothing.*
<USER>: "So, this is why Sayori is Vice President..."
*I whisper to Monika.*
*She nods in return.*
Monika: "I might come off as a good leader, and I can organize things..."
Monika: "I couldn't even bring myself to interject."
<USER>: "Nah..."
<USER>: "It's not like I can blame you."
<USER>: "I wasn't able to say anything, either."
Monika: "Well..."
<USER>: "<USER> could say that."
<USER>: "She might be an airhead, but sometimes it's weirdly suspicious that she knows exactly what she's doing."
Monika: "Take good care of her, okay?"
Monika: "I would hate to see her get herself hurt."
<USER>: "That makes two of us..."
<USER>: "<USER> can count on me."
*Monika smiles sweetly at me, causing my stomach to knot.*
*Such a genuine person really does make a good President, regardless of what she says.*
*If only I could get the chance to talk to her a little more...*
Sayori: "[gtext]"
*I see an annoying girl running toward me from the distance, waving her arms in the air like she's totally oblivious to any attention she might draw to herself.*
*That girl is [s_name], my neighbor and good friend since we were children.*
*You know, the kind of friend you'd never see yourself making today, but it just kind of works out because you've known each other for so long?*
*We used to walk to school together on days like this, but starting around high school she would oversleep more and more frequently, and I would get tired of waiting up.*
*But if she's going to chase after me like this, I almost feel better off running away.*
*However, I just sigh and idle in front of the crosswalk and let [s_name] catch up to me.*
Sayori: "{cps=60}[gtext]{/cps}{nw}"
Sayori: "{cps=60}[gtext]{/cps}{nw}"
*Another day passes, and it's time for the club meeting already.*
*I've gotten a little more comfortable here over the past couple days.*
*Entering the clubroom, the usual scene greets me.*
Sayori: "Hi <USER>~"
<USER>: "Yo, Sayori."
<USER>: "Looks like you're in a good mood today."
Sayori: "I'm just still not used to you being in the club, that's all."
<USER>: "I see..."
<USER>: "...That's a pretty simple thing to get you in a good mood."
<USER>: "But I guess it's always the simple things with you, anyway."
Sayori: "I'm kinda hungry..."
Sayori: "Will you come with me to buy a snack?"
<USER>: "No thanks."
Sayori: "T-That's not like you at all!!"
<USER>: "I have my reasons."
<USER>: "Why don't we take a look at your purse, Sayori?"
Sayori: "Why that...all of a sudden?"
<USER>: "No reason, really."
<USER>: "I just wanted to look at it."
*Sayori nervously retrieves her coin purse.*
*She fumbles with the latch and gets it open.*
*Then, she turns it upside-down and lets its contents spill onto the desk.*
*Only two small coins fall out.*
<USER>: "I knew it..."
<USER>: "I can see right through you, Sayori."
Sayori: "How did you even know?"
<USER>: "It's simple."
<USER>: "If you had enough money in the first place, you would have bought a snack before coming to the clubroom."
<USER>: "So, either you're not hungry and wanted an excuse to take a walk..."
<USER>: "Or, you planned to conveniently forget that you spent all your money, so that I would lend you some!"
<USER>: "But there's one more thing..."
<USER>: "...<USER>'re always hungry!"
<USER>: "And so, that only leaves the one option!"
Sayori: "I give up!"
Sayori: "Don't make me feel guiltyyy!"
<USER>: "If you feel guilty, that means you deserve to feel guilty..."
Yuri: "Ahaha."
*Yuri suddenly giggles.*
<USER>: "Eh?"
*I didn't notice that she was listening in.*
*Her face is in her book, as always.*
Yuri: "A-Ah!"
Yuri: "I wasn't listening or anything--!"
Sayori: "Tell <USER> to let me borrow some money..."
Yuri: "Don't get me involved like that, Sayori..."
Yuri: "Besides..."
Yuri: "And frankly, after pulling a mischievous little stunt like that, your suffering is fair enough retribution."
<USER>: "..."
Yuri: "Did I just..."
Yuri: "I got too absorbed into my book..."
Yuri: "Uu..."
Sayori: "It doesn't happen much, but it's a fun side of you!"
Yuri: "There's no way you could think that..."
Sayori: "I did something bad and now I have to accept the revolution."
Yuri: "Still, coming from you, Sayori..."
<USER>: "Don't let her fool you."
<USER>: "Sayori knows exactly what she's doing."
<USER>: "After all, she told you guys she was bringing me to the club before she even told me..."
Sayori: "You wouldn't have come if it weren't for the cupcakes..."
Sayori: "So I had to trick Natsuki into making them!"
<USER>: "Come on, give me more credit than that, Sayori."
*{i}Pwap!{/i}*
*Out of nowhere, something smacks Sayori in the face and tumbles onto the desk.*
Sayori: "What was--"
Sayori: "A-A cookie!"
*Sure enough, it's a giant cookie wrapped in plastic.*
*Sayori glances around.*
Sayori: "It's because I paid my restitution!"
<USER>: "Retribution..."
Natsuki: "Ahahaha!"
Natsuki: "I {i}was{/i} just gonna give it to you."
Natsuki: "It was totally worth seeing your reaction, though. Ahaha!"
Sayori: "That's so nice of you!"
*Sayori hugs the cookie.*
<USER>: "Jeez, just eat it..."
*Sayori rapidly tears open the wrapper and takes a big bite.*
*Sayori suddenly clasps her hands over her mouth.*
Natsuki: "You're going through a lot over just one cookie."
*Natsuki takes a bite of her own cookie.*
Sayori: "Can I try it?"
Natsuki: "Beggars can't be choosers!"
Sayori: "Ehehe~"
*Sayori gets out of her seat and goes behind Natsuki, then wraps her arms around her.*
Natsuki: "I get it, I get it."
*Cookie still in hand, Natsuki reaches up to nudge Sayori off of her.*
Sayori: "...{i}Om.{/i}"
*Sayori suddenly leans down and takes a bite out of Natsuki's cookie.*
Natsuki: "Did you seriously just do that?!"
*Mouth full, Sayori trots away to safety.*
*Yuri and I laugh as well.*
*Natsuki glances around.*
*Monika isn't in the clubroom.*
Natsuki: "Where's Monika, anyway?"
Yuri: "Good question..."
Yuri: "Have any of you heard anything about her being late today?"
Sayori: "Not me..."
<USER>: "Yeah, I haven't either."
Yuri: "That's a bit unusual."
Natsuki: "Of course she's okay."
Natsuki: "She probably just had something to do today."
Sayori: "Eh?"
Sayori: "You don't think she..."
Sayori: "She has a...!"
Yuri: "Ahaha. I wouldn't be surprised."
Yuri: "She's probably more desirable than all of us combined."
Sayori: "Ehehe, that's true..."
Natsuki: "Excuse me?!"
*Suddenly, the door swings open.*
Monika: "Sorry! I'm super sorry!"
<USER>: "Ah, there you are..."
Monika: "I didn't mean to be late..."
Monika: "I hope you guys weren't worried or anything!"
Sayori: "Eh??"
Sayori: "Monika chose the club over her boyfriend after all!"
Sayori: "You're so strong-willed!"
Monika: "What on Earth are you talking about?"
*Monika quizzically glances at me.*
<USER>: "Ah, never mind that..."
<USER>: "What held you up, anyway?"
Monika: "Well, my last period today was study hall."
Monika: "To be honest, I kind of just lost track of time..."
Monika: "Ahaha..."
Natsuki: "That makes no sense, though."
Natsuki: "You would have heard the bell ring, at least."
Yuri: "Piano...?"
Yuri: "I wasn't aware you played music as well, Monika."
Monika: "I kind of just started recently."
Sayori: "That's so cool!"
Sayori: "You should play something for us, Monika!"
Monika: "That's..."
*Monika looks at me.*
<USER>: "That sounds cool."
<USER>: "I'd also look forward to it."
Monika: "In that case..."
Monika: "I won't let you down, <USER>."
*Monika smiles sweetly.*
<USER>: "Ah..."
<USER>: "I didn't mean any pressure or anything like that!"
Monika: "I've been practicing a whole lot recently."
Monika: "And I'd really love the chance to share once I'm ready."
<USER>: "I see..."
<USER>: "In that case, best of luck."
<USER>: "Not...not really."
*I choose to leave out Sayori's mischievous escapade.*
*I'm sure Natsuki will end up complaining to her, anyway.*
*It looks like everyone has already settled down.*
*Sayori somehow already finished her entire cookie.*
*Yuri is back to her book, and Natsuki disappeared into the closet.*
Monika: "Okay, everyone!"
Monika: "We're all done reading each other's poems, right?"
Monika: "I have something extra planned today, so if everyone could come sit at the front of the room..."
Natsuki: "Is this about the festival?"
Monika: "Well, sort of~"
Natsuki: "Ugh. Do we really have to do something for the festival?"
Natsuki: "It's not like we can put together anything good in just a few days."
Natsuki: "We'll just end up embarrassing ourselves instead of getting any new members."
Yuri: "That's a concern of mine as well."
Yuri: "I don't really do well with last-minute preparations..."
Monika: "We're going to keep it simple, okay?"
Monika: "Sayori has been working on posters, and I've designed some pamphlets we can give out during the event."
Natsuki: "Okay, that's great and all..."
Natsuki: "But that doesn't tell us what we're actually going to be doing for the event."
Monika: "But the cool part is, we're also going to let anyone else come up and recite poems too!"
Sayori: "Ehehe~"
*Sayori, who's been coloring a poster, holds it up for us to see.*
Natsuki: "Are you kidding me, Monika?"
Natsuki: "You didn't...you didn't already start putting those posters up, did you?"
Monika: "Do you really think it's that bad of an idea...?"
Natsuki: "Well, no."
Natsuki: "It's not a bad idea."
*Imagining it, Yuri shakes her head in fear.*
Sayori: "Guys..."
Monika: "I understand where they're coming from."
Monika: "Remember that Natsuki and Yuri have never shared their poems with anyone until just a couple days ago..."
Monika: "It's a lot to ask for them to recite their poems out loud to a whole room full of people."
Monika: "So, I'm sorry."
Natsuki: "..."
Monika: "I still think we should give it our best!"
Monika: "If we start the event and each put on a good performance..."
Monika: "And the more people who perform, the better we'll be able to show everyone what literature is all about!"
Sayori: "Yeah!"
Sayori: "Being intimate with yourself..."
Sayori: "Finding new horizons..."
Sayori: "And having fun!"
Monika: "And it's those reasons that we're all in this club today."
Monika: "To inspire them to find the same feelings that brought you here in the first place?"
Monika: "I know we all do."
Monika: "...Then I know you can do it!"
Natsuki: "..."
Yuri: "..."
*Natsuki and Yuri remain silent.*
*Sayori looks worried.*
*I guess that leaves me no choice...*
<USER>: "I agree..."
<USER>: "I don't think it's too much to ask."
<USER>: "I think that Sayori and Monika have been trying really hard to get new members."
<USER>: "The least we can do is help them out a little bit."
Natsuki: "..."
*It looks like Natsuki doesn't have any arguments left.*
Natsuki: "Uu..."
Natsuki: "I guess I'll just have to get it over with."
Monika: "Thanks, Natsuki."
Monika: "What about you, Yuri...?"
Yuri: "..."
*Yuri dejectedly glances around at everyone else's expectant faces.*
Yuri: "Sigh..."
Yuri: "I-I guess I don't really have a choice..."
Sayori: "You're the best, Yuri~"
Yuri: "This club is seriously going to be the death of me..."
Monika: "But anyway..."
Monika: "I want each of you to choose a poem of yours."
Monika: "We're going to practice reciting them in front of each other."
Yuri: "Monika...!"
Yuri: "This is too sudden...!"
Yuri: "Oh no..."
Monika: "I'll start off to help everyone feel a little more comfortable."
Sayori: "Can I go next??"
Monika: "Ahaha. Of course."
*Monika flips through her notebook to the specific poem she has in mind for herself.*
*She then stands behind the podium.*
*Monika begins reciting her poem.*
*Her clear, confident voice fills the room.*
*More than that, her inflection is pristine.*
*She knows exactly how to apply emotion behind each line she recites, bringing the words to life.*
*Is this something she's done before, or is she simply a natural?*
*I glance around me.*
*Everyone has their eyes on Monika.*
*Sayori looks amazed.*
*Yuri has an intense expression on her face that I don't understand.*
*Finally, Monika finishes the recitation.*
*The four of us applaud.*
*Monika takes a breath and smiles.*
Sayori: "That...that was so good, Monika!"
Monika: "Are you ready to go next, Sayori?"
Yuri: "I...I'll go next!!"
*Yuri clutches a sheet of paper between her hands and stands up.*
*Keeping her head down, she walks quickly over to the podium.*
*Yuri anxiously glances at each of us.*
Sayori: "You can do it, Yuri..."
Yuri: "It...It's called...{i}Afterimage of a Crimson Eye{/i}."
*Yuri's voice shakes as she starts reading the poem.*
*Just a moment ago, she practically refused to do this.*
*Why is she suddenly putting in so much effort?*
*As Yuri gets past the first couple of lines, her voice changes.*
*It's almost like what happens when Yuri gets absorbed into her books.*
*Her quivering words transform into the sharp syllables of a fierce and confident woman.*
*The poem is full of twists and turns in its structure that she enunciates with perfect timing.*
*This must be a rare glimpse into the whirling fire Yuri keeps concealed inside her head...!*
*Suddenly, she's finished.*
*Everyone is stunned.*
*Yuri snaps back into reality and glances around her, as if she bewildered even herself.*
*...It's up to me to save this situation.*
*I'm the first to start applauding.*
*Everyone joins me afterward, and we give Yuri the recognition she deserves.*
*It's not that we didn't want to applaud for her.*
*But we were caught so off-guard that we must have forgotten.*
*As we applaud, Yuri holds the poem to her chest and rushes back into her seat.*
Monika: "Yuri, that was really good."
Monika: "Thank you for sharing."
Yuri: "..."
*Looks like Yuri is down for the count...*
Sayori: "Okaay~"
Sayori: "I guess I'm next, then!"
*Sayori hops out of her chair and cheerfully walks to the podium.*
Sayori: "Ah..."
<USER>: "Sayori..."
Sayori: "How did you guys do it so easily?"
Monika: "Ah..."
Monika: "Try not to think of it like you're reciting to other people."
Monika: "Imagine you're reciting it to yourself, like in front of a mirror, or in your own head."
Monika: "It's your poem, so it'll come out the best that way."
Sayori: "I see, I see..."
Sayori: "Okay, then..."
*Sayori begins her poem.*
*Somehow, it feels like her soft voice was made as a perfect match.*
*The poem isn't aimlessly cheery like Sayori is.*
*It's serene and bittersweet.*
*If I were to read this on paper, I probably wouldn't think much of it...*
*But hearing it come from Sayori's voice almost gives it a whole new meaning.*
*Maybe this is what Sayori meant when she said she likes my poems.*
*It's like I get to reach more deeply into someone I thought I knew through and through.*
*Sayori finishes, and we applaud.*
<USER>: "Good job, Sayori."
Sayori: "Ehehe, even <USER> liked it."
Sayori: "I guess that's a good sign~"
<USER>: "What does that even mean...?"
Monika: "It came out nicely, Sayori."
Monika: "The atmosphere of the poem fits you really nicely."
Monika: "But it might be that other poems wouldn't work quite as well with that kind of delivery..."
Monika: "They might need a little more force behind them, depending on what you're reading..."
Sayori: "That's...well, I've been practicing that kind of thing..."
Sayori: "Ehehe..."
Monika: "We don't have much time before the festival, you know?"
Monika: "Natsuki?"
Natsuki: "Hmph."
Natsuki: "Don't make me go before <USER>."
Natsuki: "It's not like I can compare to you guys, anyway..."
Natsuki: "Might as well let <USER> lower everyone's standards a little before I have to do it."
<USER>: "It's fine, it's fine."
<USER>: "I might as well get it over with."
<USER>: "But it's not like I have much of a selection of what to read..."
<USER>: "I'll just have to go with what I wrote for today."
*I stand up and step in front of the podium.*
*Everyone has their eyes on me, making me feel terribly awkward.*
*I recite my poem.*
*Since I'm not exactly confident in my own writing, it's hard to put energy into it.*
*Despite that, once I finish, I receive applause anyway.*
<USER>: "Sorry I'm not really as good as everyone else..."
Monika: "I think it's less about your abilities, and more about your lack of confidence in your writing."
Monika: "That's something that'll improve over time, though."
<USER>: "Yeah... Maybe."
Natsuki: "I'm going."
*Natsuki begrudgingly gets out of her seat and makes her way to the podium.*
Monika: "Because you're presenting..."
*Natsuki takes a breath.*
*Once she starts reciting the poem, her sour attitude disappears a little.*
*While she's still a little unenthused, her poem has a rhythm and rhyme to it.*
*It's Natsuki's trademark style, and it works surprisingly well when spoken aloud.*
*The words feel like they bounce up and down, as if giving life to the poem.*
*Natsuki finishes, and everyone applauds.*
*She huffs back to her seat.*
Monika: "That wasn't so bad, was it?"
Natsuki: "Easy for you to say..."
Natsuki: "You'd better not make me do that again."
Monika: "Ah, well..."
Monika: "Do you at least feel prepared enough to recite a poem in front of other people?"
Natsuki: "I mean, doing it in front of other people will be way easier!"
Natsuki: "I can put on whatever face I want for other people."
Natsuki: "It's just...embarrassing."
Sayori: "That's a surprise, Natsuki..."
Sayori: "I think it would be the other way around for me."
Natsuki: "Well, that's just how it is, so..."
Monika: "You won't have much to worry about for the festival."
Monika: "It might be hard, but I hope that you all have an idea of what it's like now."
Monika: "I'll be making pamphlets, so let me know ahead of time what you'll be reciting."
<USER>: "Jeez..."
<USER>: "I should probably find some other poem to recite instead."
Monika: "I'm already pleasantly surprised that you're putting in all this effort for the club."
<USER>: "Ah... Yeah, no problem..."
Monika: "I think that's about it for today."
Monika: "I know the festival is coming up, but let's try to write poems for tomorrow, as well."
Monika: "It's been working out really nicely so far, so I'd like to continue that."
Monika: "As for the festival, we'll finish planning tomorrow, and then we'll have the weekend to prepare."
Monika: "Monday's the big day!"
Sayori: "I can't wait~!"
Yuri: "I can do this... I can do this..."
<USER>: "Alright--"
*I stand up.*
*There's no way I'll be able to find the same enthusiasm as Sayori and Monika, but I'll do my best to get through it.*
*If it's for the sake of the club...*
*And impressing Monika...*
*Then I'll have to do my best.*
<USER>: "Ready to go, Sayori?"
Natsuki: "Look at you two, always going home together like that."
Monika: "It's kind of adorable, isn't it?"
<USER>: "Jeez, guys..."
<USER>: "Don't make such a big deal out of it."
Yuri: "It must be a little nice, though..."
<USER>: "Well..."
<USER>: "Ah..."
*How am I supposed to respond to that?*
<USER>: "...Whatever. Let's go already."
*I walk home with Sayori once more.*
*Even though it's only been a few days, a lot of things have already changed.*
*But today, Sayori is being a little quieter than usual on the way home.*
<USER>: "Hey, Sayori..."
Sayori: "..."
<USER>: "Ah, no wonder..."
Sayori: "I was...thinking about something from earlier."
Sayori: "I like how we get to..."
*Sayori fumbles with her words.*
<USER>: "Huh?!"
Sayori: "What would you do?"
<USER>: "What kind of question is that...?"
<USER>: "<USER>'re kind of putting me on the spot here..."
*Then again, the festival is only a few days away...*
*Who knows what will happen in that time?*
<USER>: "Sayori..."
<USER>: "<USER> really think I would ditch you for [ch2_winner]?"
Sayori: "B-But..."
<USER>: "Jeez..."
<USER>: "I already see her in the club every day."
<USER>: "Besides, you always seem to really like going home together..."
<USER>: "I wouldn't just ruin that for you."
Sayori: "You think about me too much sometimes."
Sayori: "[ch2_winner] would deserve it if she wanted it, so..."
<USER>: "Sayori, I've already made up my mind."
<USER>: "I really can't figure you out sometimes..."
Sayori: "Sorry..."
<USER>: "Besides, what's the point in speculating something that's never going to happen?"
*The conversation trails off.*
*It's kind of a weird thing for Sayori to care so much about...*
*But I want to respect her and keep her happy, too.*
<USER>: "Walking home with Natsuki, huh..."
*Why does the thought of that make my heart pound...?*
<USER>: "I mean..."
<USER>: "I think I would be afraid of what she'd do to me if I turned her down..."
<USER>: "Walking home with Yuri, huh..."
*Why does the thought of that make my heart pound...?*
<USER>: "I mean..."
<USER>: "Given how hard it is for her to socialize, I would feel awful turning her down, so..."
<USER>: "That has nothing to do with what I just said!"
<USER>: "Jeez..."
<USER>: "There's not even any point in speculating something that's never going to happen."
Sayori: "But I just like to think about it."
<USER>: "Need you...?"
<USER>: "Sayori..."
<USER>: "I can't figure out how you're seeing things in your head right now."
Sayori: "Sorry..."
<USER>: "Everyone is different..."
<USER>: "Nobody in the club is a replacement for you."
Sayori: "If you say so..."
*The conversation trails off, and I'm left feeling awkward.*
*But it was kind of her fault for trapping me with such a weird question...*
*I can't just lie to her.*
*But if there's something that makes her happy, I would hate to take that away from her.*
*That's why I said there's no point in speculating.*
*It's an ordinary school day, like any other.*
*Mornings are usually the worst, being surrounded by couples and friend groups walking to school together.*
*Meanwhile, I've always walked to school alone.*
*I always tell myself it's about time I meet some girls or something like that...*
*But I have no motivation to join any clubs.*
*I'm perfectly content just getting by on the average while spending my free time on games and anime.*
*There's always the anime club, but it's not like there would be any girls in it anyway...*
*The school day is as ordinary as ever, and it's over before I know it.*
*After I pack up my things, I stare blankly at the wall, looking for an ounce of motivation.*
<USER>: "Clubs..."
*There really aren't any that interest me.*
*Besides, most of them would probably be way too demanding for me to want to deal with.*
*I guess I have no choice but to start with the anime club...*
Monika: "...<USER>?"
<USER>: "...Monika?"
<USER>: "Ah..."
<USER>: "Yeah, it has."
*Monika smiles sweetly.*
*We do know each other - well, we rarely talked, but we were in the same class last year.*
*Monika was probably the most popular girl in class - smart, beautiful, athletic.*
*Basically, completely out of my league.*
*So, having her smile at me so genuinely feels a little...*
<USER>: "What did you come in here for, anyway?"
Monika: "Or markers?"
<USER>: "I guess you could check the closet."
<USER>: "...<USER>'re in the debate club, right?"
Monika: "I actually quit the debate club."
<USER>: "Really? <USER> quit?"
Monika: "Yeah..."
Monika: "It feels like nothing but arguing about the budget and publicity and how to prepare for events..."
Monika: "I'd much rather take something I personally enjoy and make something special out of it."
<USER>: "In that case, what club did you decide to join?"
Monika: "A literature club!{nw}"
Monika: "A literature club!{fast}"
<USER>: "Literature...?"
*That sounds kind of...dull?*
<USER>: "How many members do you have so far?"
Monika: "Ahaha..."
Monika: "It's kind of embarrassing, but there are only three of us so far."
Monika: "It's really hard to find new members for something that sounds so boring..."
<USER>: "Well, I can see that..."
Monika: "Literature can be anything. Reading, writing, poetry..."
<USER>: "Wait...really?"
Monika: "I mean, she's not wrong, I guess..."
Monika: "And besides, a member's a member, right?"
*...Did Monika say \*she\*?*
*Hmm...*
Monika: "By any chance...are you still looking for a club to join?"
<USER>: "Ah--"
<USER>: "I mean, I guess so, but..."
Monika: "In that case..."
Monika: "I won't ask you to join, but..."
Monika: "If you could at the very least visit my club, it would make me really happy."
Monika: "Please?"
<USER>: "Um..."
*Well, I guess I have no reason to refuse...*
*Besides, how could I ever refuse someone like Monika?*
<USER>: "Sure, I guess I could check it out."
<USER>: "I-It's nothing, really..."
Monika: "I'll look for the materials another time - you're more important."
*And thus, today marks the day I sold my soul to Monika and her irresistible smile.*
*I timidly follow Monika across the school and upstairs - a section of the school I rarely visit, being generally used for third-year classes and activities.*
*Monika, full of energy, swings open the classroom door.*
Monika: "I'm back~!"
Monika: "And I brought a guest with me!"
Yuri: "Eh?"
Yuri: "A...a guest?"
Natsuki: "Seriously? You brought a boy?"
Natsuki: "Way to kill the atmosphere."
Monika: "Don't be mean, Natsuki..."
<USER>: "..."
*All words escape me in this situation.*
*This club...*
*{i}...is full of incredibly cute girls!!{/i}*
Natsuki: "You're Monika's boyfriend, right?"
<USER>: "Wha--"
<USER>: "No, I'm not!"
*The girl with the sour attitude, whose name is apparently Natsuki, is one I don't recognize.*
*Her small figure makes me think she's probably a first-year.*
*Yuri, who appears comparably more mature and timid, seems to have a hard time keeping up with someone like Natsuki.*
<USER>: "Yeah... It's nice to meet both of you."
Monika: "Isn't that great?"
Natsuki: "Didn't I tell you to let me know in advance before you brought anyone new?"
Monika: "I didn't forget that, but I just happened to run into him."
Monika: "Why don't you come sit down, <USER>?"
*The girls have a few desks arranged to form a table.*
*Yuri walks to the corner of the room and opens the closet.*
*Meanwhile, Monika and Natsuki sit across from each other.*
*Still feeling awkward, I take a seat next to Monika.*
Monika: "So, I know you didn't really plan on coming here..."
Monika: "But we'll make sure you feel right at home, okay?"
<USER>: "I'm surprised there aren't more people in the club yet."
<USER>: "It must be hard to start a new club."
Monika: "Not many people are very interested in putting out all the effort to start something brand new..."
Monika: "Especially when it's something that doesn't grab your attention, like literature."
Monika: "You have to work hard to convince people that you're both fun and worthwhile."
Monika: "But it makes school events, like the festival, that much more important."
Monika: "Right, Natsuki?"
Natsuki: "Well..."
Natsuki: "...I guess."
*Natsuki reluctantly agrees.*
*Such different girls, all interested in the same goal...*
*Monika must have worked really hard just to find these two.*
*Yuri returns to the table, carrying a tea set.*
*She carefully places a teacup in front of each of us before setting down the teapot in the middle.*
<USER>: "<USER> keep a whole tea set in this classroom?"
Yuri: "Don't worry, the teachers gave us permission."
Yuri: "After all, doesn't a hot cup of tea help you enjoy a good book?"
<USER>: "Ah... I-I guess..."
Monika: "Ehehe, don't let yourself get intimidated, Yuri's just trying to impress you."
*Insulted, Yuri looks away.*
<USER>: "I believe you."
<USER>: "Well, tea and reading might not be a pastime for me, but I at least enjoy tea."
*Yuri faintly smiles to herself in relief.*
Yuri: "So, <USER>, what kinds of things do you like to read?"
<USER>: "Well... Ah..."
*Considering how little I've read these past few years, I don't really have a good way of answering that.*
<USER>: "...Manga..."
*I mutter quietly to myself, half-joking.*
*Natsuki's head suddenly perks up.*
*It looks like she wants to say something, but she keeps quiet.*
<USER>: "...Well, that can change..."
*What am I saying?*
*I spoke without thinking after seeing Yuri's sad smile.*
<USER>: "Anyway, what about you, Yuri?"
*Yuri traces the rim of her teacup with her finger.*
Yuri: "The level of creativity and craftsmanship behind them is amazing to me."
*Yuri goes on, clearly passionate about her reading.*
*She seemed so reserved and timid since the moment I walked in, but it's obvious by the way her eyes light up that she finds her comfort in the world of books, not people.*
Yuri: "Stories with deep psychological elements usually immerse me as well."
Yuri: "Anyway, I've been reading a lot of horror lately..."
<USER>: "Ah, I read a horror book once..."
*I desperately grasp something I can relate to at the minimal level.*
*At this rate, Yuri might as well be having a conversation with a rock.*
Monika: "Ahaha. I'd expect that from you, Yuri."
Yuri: "Really, if a story makes me think, or takes me to another world, then I really can't put it down."
Yuri: "Surreal horror is often very successful at changing the way you look at the world, if only for a brief moment."
Natsuki: "Ugh, I hate horror..."
*Natsuki's eyes dart over to me for a split second.*
Natsuki: "W-What?"
Natsuki: "What gives you that idea?"
Monika: "It looked like you were working on a poem called--"
Natsuki: "Don't say it out loud!!"
Natsuki: "And give that back!"
<USER>: "Natsuki, you write your own poems?"
Natsuki: "Why do you care?"
<USER>: "I think that's impressive."
<USER>: "Why don't you share them sometime?"
*Natsuki averts her eyes.*
Natsuki: "You wouldn't...like them..."
<USER>: "Ah...not a very confident writer yet?"
Yuri: "Sharing that level of writing takes more than just confidence."
Yuri: "You must be willing to open up to your readers, exposing your vulnerabilities and showing even the deepest reaches of your heart."
Monika: "Do you have writing experience too, Yuri?"
Monika: "Maybe if you share some of your work, you can set an example and help Natsuki feel comfortable enough to share hers."
<USER>: "I guess it's the same for Yuri..."
*We all sit in silence for a moment.*
Monika: "How about this?"
*Natsuki and Yuri look quizzically at Monika.*
Monika: "Then, next time we meet, we'll all share them with each other."
Monika: "That way, everyone is even!"
Yuri: "..."
Monika: "Ah..."
Monika: "I mean, I thought it was a good idea..."
Yuri: "...I think you're right, Monika."
Yuri: "I need to do my best to nurture the club as well as its members."
Yuri: "It seems like a good step for us to take."
Yuri: "Do you agree as well, <USER>?"
<USER>: "Hold on...there's still one problem."
*Now that we've reached the most important topic, I bluntly come forth with what's been on my mind the entire time.*
<USER>: "I never said I would join this club!"
<USER>: "Monika may have convinced me to stop by, but I never made any decision."
<USER>: "I still have other clubs to look at, and...um..."
*I lose my train of thought.*
*All three girls stare back at me with dejected eyes.*
<USER>: "Eh...?"
*The girls exchange glances before Monika turns back to me.*
Monika: "The thing is..."
Monika: "We need four..."
Monika: "And I've been trying really, really hard to find new members."
Monika: "And if we don't find one more before the festival..."
<USER>: "..."
*I...I'm defenseless against these girls.*
*How am I supposed to make a clear-headed decision when it's like this?*
*I would feel terrible for letting everyone down in this situation...*
*And besides, the club itself seems pretty relaxed...*
*So, if writing poems is the price I need to pay in order to spend every day with these beautiful girls...*
<USER>: "...Right."
<USER>: "Okay, I've decided, then."
<USER>: "I'll join the Literature Club."
*One by one, the girls' eyes light up.*
Monika: "Oh my goodness, really?"
Monika: "Do you really mean that, <USER>?"
<USER>: "Yeah..."
<USER>: "It could be fun, right?"
Monika: "<USER>, I'm so happy..."
Monika: "I'll do everything I can to give you a great time, okay?"
<USER>: "Ah...thanks, I guess."
Monika: "I think with that, we can officially end today's meeting on a good note."
Monika: "Everyone remember tonight's assignment"
Monika: "Write a poem to bring to the next meeting, so we can all share!"
*Monika looks over at me once more.*
Monika: "Ehehe~"
<USER>: "Y-Yeah..."
*Can I really impress the class star Monika with my mediocre writing skills?*
*I already feel the anxiety welling up inside me.*
*Meanwhile, the girls continue to chit-chat as Yuri cleans up the tea set.*
<USER>: "I guess I'll be on my way, then..."
Monika: "Okay!"
Monika: "I'll see you tomorrow, then."
Monika: "I can't wait!"
*With that, I depart the clubroom and make my way home.*
*The whole way, my mind wanders back and forth between the three girls*
*Natsuki,*
*Yuri,*
*and, of course, Monika.*
*Will I really be happy spending every day after school in a literature club?*
*Perhaps I'll have the chance to grow closer to one of these girls...*
*Alright!*
*I'll just need to make the most of my circumstances, and I'm sure good fortune will find me.*
*And I guess that starts with writing a poem tonight...*
Monika: "Hi again, <USER>!"
Monika: "Glad to see you didn't run away on us. Hahaha!"
<USER>: "Nah, don't worry."
<USER>: "This might be a little strange for me, but I at least keep my word."
*Well, I'm back at the Literature Club.*
*I was the last to come in, so everyone else is already hanging out.*
Yuri: "Thanks for keeping your promise, <USER>."
Natsuki: "Oh, come on! Like he deserves any slack."
Natsuki: "I don't know if you plan to just come here and hang out, or what..."
Natsuki: "But if you don't take us seriously, then you won't see the end of it."
Monika: "Natsuki, you certainly have a big mouth for someone who keeps her manga collection in the clubroom."
*Natsuki finds herself stuck between saying \*Monika\* and \*Manga\*.*
*Swiftly defeated, Natsuki plops back into her seat.*
Yuri: "I'm sorry, <USER>..."
Yuri: "We'll make sure to put your comfort first, okay?"
*Yuri shoots Natsuki with a disappointed glance.*
Yuri: "Now that you're in the club and all..."
Yuri: "...Perhaps you might have interest in picking up a book to read?"
<USER>: "Well..."
<USER>: "I can't really say no either way."
<USER>: "Like you said, I'm in this club now."
<USER>: "So it only feels right for me to do something like that, if you ask."
Yuri: "I didn't mean it like that!"
Yuri: "Uu..."
Yuri: "If you don't really want to, then forget I said anything, I guess..."
<USER>: "Ah--No, it's not that, Yuri."
<USER>: "I want to try to be a part of this club."
<USER>: "So even if I don't read often, I'd be happy to pick up a book if you wanted me to."
Yuri: "I just felt like..."
Yuri: "...That I should help you get started on something you might like."
*Yuri reaches into her bag and pulls out a book.*
Yuri: "So I picked out a book that I thought you might enjoy."
Yuri: "It's a short read, so it should keep your attention, even if you don't usually read."
Yuri: "And we could, you know..."
*Th-This is...*
*How is this girl accidentally being so cute?*
*She even picked out a book she thinks I'll like, despite me not reading much...*
<USER>: "Yuri, thank you! I'll definitely read this!"
*I enthusiastically take the book.*
Yuri: "Phew..."
Yuri: "I look forward to hearing what you think."
*Now that everyone's settled in, I expected Monika to kick off some scheduled activities for the club.*
*But that doesn't seem to be the case.*
*Yuri's face is already buried in a book.*
*I can't help but notice her intense expression, like she was waiting for this chance.*
*Meanwhile, Natsuki is rummaging around in the closet.*
<USER>: "Phew..."
*I guess that's everyone.*
*I glance around the room.*
*That was a little more stressful than I anticipated.*
*It's as if everyone is judging me for my mediocre writing abilities...*
*Even if they're just being nice, there's no way my poems can stand up to theirs.*
*This is a literature club, after all.*
*I sigh.*
*I guess that's what I ended up getting myself into.*
*Across the room, Monika is writing something in her notebook.*
*My eyes land on Yuri and Natsuki.*
*They gingerly exchange sheets of paper, sharing their respective poems.*
*As they read in tandem, I watch each of their expressions change.*
*Natsuki's eyebrows furrow in frustration.*
*Meanwhile, Yuri smiles sadly.*
Yuri: "Um...did you say something?"
*Natsuki dismissively returns the poem to the desk with one hand.*
Natsuki: "I guess you could say it's fancy."
Yuri: "Yours is...cute..."
Natsuki: "It's clearly about the feeling of giving up."
Natsuki: "How can that be cute?"
Yuri: "I just meant..."
Yuri: "I was trying to say something nice..."
Natsuki: "Eh?"
Natsuki: "Thanks, but it really didn't come out nice at all!"
Yuri: "Well, I do have a couple suggestions..."
Natsuki: "If I was looking for suggestions, I would have asked someone who actually liked it."
Natsuki: "Which people {i}did{/i}, by the way."
Natsuki: "And <USER> did, too!"
Natsuki: "So based on that, I'll gladly give you some suggestions of my own."
Natsuki: "First of all--"
Yuri: "I appreciate the offer, but I've spent a long time establishing my writing style."
Yuri: "Which I haven't yet."
Yuri: "He even told me he was impressed by it."
*Natsuki suddenly stands up.*
Natsuki: "I didn't realize you were so invested in trying to impress our new member, Yuri."
Yuri: "That's not what I...!"
Yuri: "You...You're just..."
*Yuri stands up as well.*
Natsuki: "Are you that full of yourself?"
Yuri: "No..."
Yuri: "If I was full of myself..."
Natsuki: "Well, you know what?!"
Natsuki: "I wasn't the one whose boobs magically grew a size bigger as soon as <USER> started showing up!!"
Yuri: "N-Natsuki!!"
Monika: "Um, Natsuki, that's a little--"
Yuri: "Taking out your own insecurities on others like that..."
Yuri: "You really act as young as you look, Natsuki."
Yuri: "Edgy...?"
Natsuki: "Just saying that proves my point!"
Yuri: "If you want to prove anything, then stop harassing others with your sickening attitude!"
Yuri: "You think you can counterbalance your toxic personality just by dressing and acting cute?"
Natsuki: "Oh, my bad... You already do, don't you?"
Natsuki: "Let <USER> hear everything you really think!"
Natsuki: "I'm sure he'll be head over heels for you after this!"
*Suddenly, Yuri turns toward me, as if she just noticed I was standing here.*
Yuri: "She-- She's just trying to make me look bad...!"
Natsuki: "She started it!"
<USER>: "..."
*{cps=*2}How did I get dragged into this in the first place?!{/cps}{nw}*
*{cps=*2}It's not like I know anything about writing...{/cps}{nw}*
*{cps=*2}But whomever I agree with, they'll probably think more highly of me!{/cps}{nw}*
*{cps=*2}So, of course that's going to be...!{/cps}{nw}*
Monika: "..."
Monika: "..."
Monika: "..."
Monika: "Um..."
Monika: "Hey, <USER>..."
Monika: "Why don't we\nstep outside for\na little bit?"
Monika: "Okay?"
Monika: "Sorry about that..."
Monika: "They really shouldn't have tried to get you involved."
Monika: "We'll go back inside once they're done yelling."
Monika: "Some president I am, right?"
Monika: "I just wish I was able to be a little more assertive sometimes."
Monika: "But I never have it in me to put my foot down against others..."
Monika: "Anyway..."
*Suddenly, Natsuki runs out of the classroom.*
Natsuki: "..."
*She quickly runs away.*
Monika: "Oh dear..."
Monika: "...Well, it looks like they're done..."
Yuri: "I didn't mean it..."
Yuri: "I didn't mean it..."
Yuri: "I didn't mean it..."
*Yuri is rocking back and forth in her desk with her palms on her forehead.*
<USER>: "Yuri...?"
Yuri: "I didn't mean it!!"
<USER>: "I-I believe you..."
*I have no idea what Yuri might have said to Natsuki.*
*Or did.*
Yuri: "<USER>."
Yuri: "Please don't hate me."
Yuri: "Please!"
Yuri: "I'm not like this!"
Yuri: "There's something wrong with me today..."
Monika: "It's fine, Yuri."
Monika: "We know you didn't mean it."
Monika: "Anyway, the meeting is over, so you can go home now if you want."
*Yuri looks at me like she wants to say something.*
*But she keeps glancing at Monika.*
Yuri: "I'd like to stay a little bit longer."
Monika: "I'll wait for you to be done."
Yuri: "..."
Yuri: "Well-- I'm Vice President, so..."
Yuri: "Please let me take that responsibility today."
Yuri: "It would just be...embarrassing with you listening..."
*images/yuri/1r.png*
*Another day passes, and it's time for the club meeting already.*
*I've gotten a little more comfortable here over the past couple days.*
*Entering the clubroom, the usual scene greets me.*
Yuri: "Welcome back, <USER>..."
<USER>: "Ah, hi Yuri..."
*I'm not sure if it's me, or if it's Yuri's expression...*
*But the weight of yesterday's quarrel still hangs in the air a little.*
*Yuri glances over her shoulder, looking around the room.*
*Natsuki is reading manga at a desk.*
*And surprisingly, Monika isn't here yet.*
*Suddenly, Yuri takes my arm and pulls me to the corner of the room.*
Yuri: "About yesterday..."
Yuri: "I..."
Yuri: "Nothing like that has ever happened before..."
Yuri: "I wasn't acting mentally sound."
Yuri: "Not just me, but Natsuki as well..."
<USER>: "Yuri..."
<USER>: "I'm happy that you were considerate and apologized."
<USER>: "<USER> don't have to worry too much."
<USER>: "Even though I've only been here a couple days, I could tell something was off yesterday..."
<USER>: "Maybe we were just a little extra sensitive because it was our first time sharing poems."
<USER>: "But whatever it was..."
<USER>: "It didn't make me think any less of you."
<USER>: "I had already decided that there's no way you can be a bad person."
<USER>: "And now that you're apologizing, I know you really didn't mean it."
Yuri: "<USER>..."
Yuri: "They make me a little too happy."
Yuri: "And I'm really glad that you joined this club."
Yuri: "Everything is a little bit brighter with you around, and--"
Yuri: "I just--"
Natsuki: "Hey, have you guys seen Monika?"
Yuri: "Ah--!"
<USER>: "No, I haven't..."
<USER>: "I was also kind of wondering where she was."
*Yuri is clearly taken aback by how calmly Natsuki is addressing her.*
Yuri: "N-No, I haven't..."
Natsuki: "I know it's stupid, but I can't help but worry a little bit..."
Natsuki: "What?"
Natsuki: "Why're you looking at me like that?"
Yuri: "U-Um..."
Yuri: "Natsuki, about yesterday..."
Yuri: "I promise I didn't mean any of the things I said!"
Yuri: "So--"
Natsuki: "Did you do something yesterday?"
Natsuki: "Whatever's on your mind, I'm sure it was nothing."
Natsuki: "I don't even remember anything bad happening."
Natsuki: "You're the kind of person who worries too much about the little things, aren't you?"
Yuri: "B-But..."
Natsuki: "Besides, it's kinda nice to hear, since I was always afraid you secretly hated me or something like that."
Yuri: "I don't hate you..."
Natsuki: "Well, you're kind of weird, but I don't hate you either."
*Natsuki turns to me.*
<USER>: "Hey...!"
*Suddenly, the door swings open.*
Monika: "Sorry! I'm super sorry!"
<USER>: "Ah, there you are..."
Monika: "I didn't mean to be late..."
Monika: "I hope you guys weren't worried or anything!"
<USER>: "Nah..."
<USER>: "Well, Natsuki was."
Monika: "Well, my last period today was study hall."
Monika: "To be honest, I kind of just lost track of time..."
Monika: "Ahaha..."
Natsuki: "You would have heard the bell ring, at least."
Yuri: "I wasn't aware you played music as well, Monika."
Yuri: "That must require a lot of dedication."
Yuri: "So, I'm still impressed."
Monika: "Ahaha, that's..."
*Monika looks at me.*
Monika: "Maybe once I get a little bit better, I will."
<USER>: "That sounds cool."
<USER>: "I look forward to it."
Monika: "In that case..."
Monika: "I won't let you down, <USER>."
*Monika smiles sweetly.*
<USER>: "Ah..."
<USER>: "I didn't mean any pressure or anything like that!"
Monika: "I was hoping that I could share it with you, anyway."
Monika: "I guess that's why I've been practicing so much recently."
<USER>: "I see..."
*I'm not sure if Monika was referring to the whole club, or just me...*
<USER>: "In that case, best of luck."
<USER>: "Not...not really."
*I choose not to bring up anything that the three of us talked about.*
*Besides, Natsuki has already run off into the closet.*
Yuri: "<USER>..."
Yuri: "Um..."
Yuri: "Since your compliments put me in a good mood..."
Yuri: "I was wondering if you would like to spend some time together today."
Yuri: "Can we start now?"
Yuri: "Let's find a place to sit--"
Yuri: "I'm being a little forceful, aren't I...?"
Yuri: "My heart...just won't stop pounding, for some reason..."
<USER>: "Don't worry about it."
<USER>: "If anything, it's nice to see you have so much energy."
Yuri: "But..."
Yuri: "I won't be able to focus on reading like this..."
<USER>: "Take your time."
*Yuri takes a deep breath, then pulls a copy of the book out of her bag.*
Monika: "Okay, everyone!"
Monika: "We're all done reading each other's poems, right?"
Monika: "We have something we need to go over today, so if everyone could come sit at the front of the room..."
Natsuki: "Is this about the festival?"
Monika: "Well, sort of~"
Natsuki: "Ugh. Do we really have to do something for the festival?"
Natsuki: "It's not like we can put together anything good in just a few days."
Natsuki: "We'll just end up embarrassing ourselves instead of getting any new members."
Yuri: "That's a concern of mine as well."
Yuri: "I don't really do well with last-minute preparations..."
Monika: "We're going to keep it simple, okay?"
Monika: "We still only have four members..."
Natsuki: "We already have enough to be considered an official club."
Natsuki: "More members will just mean everything gets noisier and more difficult to manage."
Monika: "I don't think you're looking at it the right way at all."
Monika: "Don't you want to share your passion with as many people as you can?"
Monika: "The Literature Club should be a place where people can express themselves like they can't do anywhere else."
Monika: "It should be a place so intimate that you never want to leave."
Monika: "So that's why we should work hard and put something together for the festival...even if it's something small!"
Monika: "Right, <USER>?"
<USER>: "Ah..."
Natsuki: "You can't take advantage of <USER> to agree with you just because he doesn't know how to say no to anything."
Natsuki: "Do you really think any of us here joined the club with other people in mind?"
Natsuki: "Yuri never even talked until <USER> joined."
Natsuki: "And <USER> isn't even passionate about literature in the first place."
Natsuki: "And that's everyone."
Natsuki: "The rest of us are fine like this."
*Monika is clearly taken aback by Natsuki's words.*
<USER>: "..."
*I don't know about Yuri, but I'm kind of indifferent.*
*If I showed as much enthusiasm as Monika wanted, then I would probably be lying.*
*Still, if it's up to me to rescue this situation...*
<USER>: "Um--"
Monika: "Natsuki's right, isn't she?"
Monika: "It's nothing more than a place for a few people to hang out."
<USER>: "But that doesn't mean that we're against getting new members or anything..."
Monika: "What were you hoping to get out of it?"
<USER>: "Well--"
*That's not really something I can be honest about, is it?*
Monika: "If I remember, you weren't even given a choice not to join."
*Monika sits down and stares at her desk.*
Monika: "What's the point of all this, anyway?"
Monika: "What if starting this club was a mistake?"
<USER>: "..."
Natsuki: "Is it a crime to be honest?"
Yuri: "It's about word choice."
Natsuki: "I just want a place that feels nice to hang out with a few friends."
Natsuki: "There aren't...there aren't many other places like that for me..."
<USER>: "She's not taking anything away--"
Natsuki: "It's not the same."
Natsuki: "If I wanted that, then I could have just joined any other stupid club."
Natsuki: "I mean..."
Natsuki: "Things were nice."
*Natsuki starts packing up her things.*
Natsuki: "I feel like...I don't belong here right now."
*Natsuki ignores Yuri and walks right out of the classroom.*
Yuri: "This is bad..."
Yuri: "I don't know what to do..."
<USER>: "Well..."
<USER>: "Do you have an opinion on the festival?"
Yuri: "I'm kind of indifferent, I guess..."
Yuri: "Who cares about that obnoxious brat?"
Yuri: "I mean, I like how nice and quiet the club is right now..."
Yuri: "And I'm just...happy with you here..."
Yuri: "I'm the Vice President..."
Yuri: "It's not right for me to ignore my responsibilities like that..."
Yuri: "Nobody would cry if she killed herself."
Yuri: "What do you want to get out of this club?"
*Yuri repeats the same question as Monika.*
*I decide giving an indirect answer is better than nothing.*
<USER>: "...I think the most important thing is for everyone to get along..."
<USER>: "...And for the club to provide something that you can't get anywhere else."
<USER>: "I don't think it's about how many members, but rather the quality of each member."
<USER>: "That's what will end up making the Literature Club a special place."
Yuri: "I really agree with you."
Yuri: "With each change in members, the identity of the club as a whole will change, too."
Yuri: "Stepping out of your comfort zone once in a while..."
<USER>: "Alright."
<USER>: "Well, maybe we can all talk to Natsuki tomorrow..."
*Yuri nods.*
Monika: "Hey, Yuri..."
Monika: "But I feel like you deserve to know that I still think you're a wonderful vice president."
Monika: "Okay?"
Yuri: "...Me too."
Monika: "Let's all go home for today."
Monika: "We'll talk about the festival tomorrow."
Yuri: "I look forward to it."
Monika: "I'm going to chat a little bit with <USER> before we leave."
Monika: "It's important to me, as President."
*Yuri looks a little troubled, but she doesn't protest.*
Yuri: "In that case, I'll see the two of you tomorrow."
*Monika waves as Yuri exits the classroom.*
Monika: "Phew..."
Monika: "<USER>, I just wanted to make sure you're enjoying your time at this club."
Monika: "I would really hate to see you unhappy."
Monika: "I don't like seeing the other girls give you a hard time."
Monika: "Sometimes it feels like you and I are the only real people here."
Monika: "You know what I mean?"
Monika: "I guess it's technically only been a couple days..."
Monika: "Things I know only you could understand."
Monika: "So that's why--\"{space=5000}{w=0.75}{nw}"
Monika: "No!\"{space=5000}{w=0.5}{nw}"
Monika: "Stop it!\"{space=5000}{w=1.0}{nw}"

Yuri: "Hi, <USER>!"
Yuri: "I've been waiting for you."
Yuri: "I brought my best tea today--"
Natsuki: "Monika!"
Natsuki: "I told you not to--"
Natsuki: "Is she really late again?"
Natsuki: "I just wasn't paying attention, okay? I'm sorry."
Monika: "What do you want to do today?"
Monika: "I was thinking we could--"
Monika: "Is that so, Yuri?"
Yuri: "<USER> is already engaged in a novel that we're reading together."
Monika: "I suppose..."
Monika: "I was just--"
Monika: "You guys can do whatever you want."
Monika: "Okay, everyone!"
Monika: "It's time to figure out the festival preparations."
Yuri: "Uu..."
Yuri: "Stagnating air is common foreshadowing that something terrible is about to happen..."
Yuri: "I'm not useless, you know!"
Yuri: "So I'm going to make decorations and set up some nice mood lighting."
Monika: "That's a great idea!"
Yuri: "What about <USER>?"
Natsuki: "You have the easiest job, Monika!"
Natsuki: "What are you trying to pull?"
Yuri: "Not only is your work already most suitable for one person..."
Yuri: "Please."
Monika: "I didn't even do anything!"
Yuri: "Just let <USER> make the choice, okay?"
Monika: "Fine."
Natsuki: "<USER>, I know how fed up you are with these two by now."
Monika: "We can meet at your house this weekend."
Monika: "I promise it'll be fun."
Monika: "Is Sunday okay with you?"
Natsuki: "Are you fucking kidding me?"
Natsuki: "This isn't fair at all!"
Monika: "It's what he chose."
Yuri: "No, it's not fair!"
Yuri: "Giving us all this work and then taking <USER> for yourself."
Yuri: "What a shameful thing to do!"
Monika: "You're being a little unreasonable here."
Yuri: "Monika, I can't believe how delusional and self-important you are!"
Yuri: "Pulling <USER> away from me every single time you're not included in something."
Yuri: "Crazy?"
Yuri: "It would be beneficial to your mental health."
Yuri: "All I want is to spend a little time with him."
Yuri: "Is that so much to ask?"
*Yuri follows Monika and Natsuki to the door.*
Monika: "Hey, <USER>..."
Monika: "Yuri is really something, isn't she?"
*Monika giggles as Yuri pushes her out the door.*
Yuri: "Finally."
Yuri: "Don't listen to her."
Yuri: "Doesn't that sound wonderful?"
Yuri: "But you know what?"
Yuri: "I've never felt this good my whole life."
Yuri: "I'm addicted to you."
Yuri: "To have someone who wants to revolve their entire life around you?"
Yuri: "But the feeling is too strong now."
Yuri: "I have to tell you!"
Yuri: "It feels like every inch of my body...every drop of blood in me...is screaming your name."
Yuri: "I don't care if Monika is listening!"
Yuri: "And I will be only yours."
Yuri: "Doesn't that sound perfect?"
Yuri: "Tell me you want to be my lover."
Yuri: "Do you accept my confession?"
Yuri: "...Ahahaha."
Yuri: "Ahahahahahaha!"
*[gtext]*
Natsuki: "Alright, it's festival time!"
Natsuki: "Wow, you got here before me?"
Natsuki: "I thought I was pretty ea--{nw}"
Natsuki: "EYAH!"
Natsuki: "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!!"
*Natsuki runs away.*
Monika: "..."
Monika: "I'm here!"
Monika: "Natsuki just ran past me..."
Monika: "...Oh."
Monika: "Well, that's a shame."
Monika: "Oh, jeez..."
Monika: "I'm super sorry!"
Monika: "It must have been pretty boring..."
Monika: "Just gimme a sec..."
*Monika lifts the foil from [gtext]'s tray and takes a cupcake.*
Monika: "I really just had to have one, since it's the last time I'll ever get the chance to."
Monika: "...But anyway, I really shouldn't be making you wait any longer."
Monika: "Aw, man..."
Monika: "I'm the last one here again!"
<USER>: "Don't worry, I just walked in too."
Yuri: "Were you practicing piano again?"
Monika: "Ahaha..."
Yuri: "Starting this club, and now picking up piano..."
Monika: "But I guess passion."
Monika: "Remember that the club wouldn't be here if it wasn't for all of you."
Natsuki: "Aaah, I can't wait for the festival!"
Natsuki: "It's gonna be great!"
Monika: "Weren't you complaining about it just yesterday, Natsuki?"
Natsuki: "Well, yeah."
Natsuki: "I'm not talking about {i}our{/i} part of the festival."
<USER>: "<USER> sound a bit like Sayori all of a sudden..."
Monika: "Squid...?"
Monika: "That's a pretty specific thing to look forward to..."
Natsuki: "Oh, come on."
Natsuki: "Are you saying you don't like squid?"
Natsuki: "You, of all people?"
Monika: "Eh? I didn't say I don't like it."
Monika: "Besides, what do you mean by 'you of all people'?"
Natsuki: "Because!"
Natsuki: "It's right in your name!"
Monika: "Eh?!"
Monika: "That's not how you say my name at all!"
Monika: "Also, that joke makes no sense in translation!"
Monika: "Ah...never mind!"
Monika: "Let's just focus on our own event for now, okay?"
Natsuki: "Ehehe."
Natsuki: "Fine, fine."
Natsuki: "Your reactions aren't as fun as Yuri's or Sayori's, anyway."
Yuri: "Excuse me..."
<USER>: "Where is Sayori, anyway...?"
<USER>: "Oh, there you are."
*Sayori is sitting at a desk in the corner of the room, looking down at nothing.*
*I walk over to her.*
<USER>: "Hey, Sayori."
*I wave my hand in front of her face.*
<USER>: "<USER>'re spacing out again."
Sayori: "A-Ah..."
Sayori: "Don't mind me."
<USER>: "Huh..."
<USER>: "Is everything alright?"
Sayori: "Why wouldn't it be?"
<USER>: "It just feels like you're a little off..."
<USER>: "Sorry for assuming things."
Sayori: "Jeez, you worry too much about me."
*Sayori shows me a big smile.*
<USER>: "Well...alright."
<USER>: "If you say so."
*I worriedly glance at Sayori before turning back toward everyone else.*
*But the conversation has already dispersed, with everyone back at their usual activities.*
*Maybe I should ask Monika if she's noticed anything about Sayori recently...*
*Since they've been preparing for the festival, they must be spending a lot of time together.*
*I timidly approach Monika, who is shuffling through some papers at her desk.*
Monika: "<USER>! What's up?"
<USER>: "Hey, this might sound a little strange, but..."
<USER>: "Have you noticed anything up with Sayori recently?"
Monika: "In what way do you mean?"
<USER>: "Maybe I'm reading into it a little too much, but she seems a bit downcast today..."
Monika: "Oh? You think so?"
Monika: "I can't say I've noticed anything about her..."
*Monika peers across the room at Sayori, who is idly dragging a rubber eraser up and down her desk.*
Monika: "Maybe there is something on her mind..."
Monika: "You certainly know her a lot better than I do."
<USER>: "Yeah, but she's never really like this..."
<USER>: "She's always talked to me about things that bothered her."
<USER>: "But this time, when I asked her, she was really dismissive."
<USER>: "...Sorry, I know it's not your problem!"
<USER>: "I just wanted to ask if you knew anything, so I'll drop it now..."
Monika: "It's important to me, too."
Monika: "And I also care about the well-being of my club members, you know?"
<USER>: "Eh? Are you sure about that...?"
<USER>: "She seemed like she wanted to be left alone..."
Monika: "Are you sure?"
Monika: "Maybe she just has a hard time bringing it up with the person of interest..."
<USER>: "Person of interest...?"
<USER>: "What do you mean by that?"
<USER>: "Me...?"
<USER>: "How on Earth would you come to that conclusion?"
Monika: "I probably shouldn't say too much, but..."
<USER>: "Eh...?"
Monika: "She's been so much happier ever since you've joined the club."
Monika: "It's like an extra light was turned on inside of her."
<USER>: "What?"
<USER>: "No way..."
<USER>: "Sayori...is always like that."
<USER>: "She's always been full of sunshine."
<USER>: "It's not any different now than it always has been."
Monika: "You're so funny, <USER>."
Monika: "Have you thought that maybe you've always seen her as so cheerful..."
Monika: "...because that's just how she is when she's around you?"
<USER>: "..."
Monika: "I'm sorry...what do I know, anyway?"
Monika: "I'll try to talk to her, so try not to think about it for now."
<USER>: "Ah..."
<USER>: "Alright..."
*Monika smiles meaningfully.*
*I know she said to forget about it...*
*But I already know that I won't be able to get her words out of my head.*
*Monika stands up from her desk and walks across the room to where Sayori is sitting.*
*I watch her kneel down next to Sayori and gently talk to her.*
*But she's keeping her voice so quiet that I can't hear her from here.*
*I sigh and sit myself down.*
*I know Sayori told me not to worry about her, and to have fun with everyone else...*
*But that's impossible to do when she's behaving like this.*
*Exactly how much do I care about her, that I'm letting this weigh me down so much?*
*Now it feels like I'm the one behaving out of the ordinary...*
*But there's nothing I can do besides wait for Monika.*
Natsuki: "Hey, you."
<USER>: "Eh?"
*I look up to see Natsuki next to me.*
Natsuki: "Are you just gonna sit there and keep staring at nothing?"
Natsuki: "There isn't that much time, so..."
<USER>: "Ah, sorry."
<USER>: "I didn't mean to make you worry or anything."
Natsuki: "I was just..."
*Natsuki glances down at her side.*
*She's holding a volume of manga in her hand.*
<USER>: "That's right..."
<USER>: "Something just came up for a minute, but we can get started now."
<USER>: "I won't make you wait any longer."
Natsuki: "Now you're making me feel like a jerk."
Natsuki: "If something's bothering you, then you can just tell me to leave you alone, and I will."
Natsuki: "Assuming you didn't feel like talking about it or anything..."
*She practically mumbles that last part.*
<USER>: "Nah...I'm probably making it seem like a bigger deal than it is."
<USER>: "I've just been thinking about Sayori, that's all."
Natsuki: "Thinking about her...?"
<USER>: "Yeah, she seems pretty down today."
<USER>: "But she didn't want to admit it to me."
<USER>: "So I can't help but wonder if something happened to her."
*Natsuki exhales.*
Natsuki: "You should really work on your phrasing!"
Natsuki: "You're her best friend, right?"
<USER>: "Yeah, I guess so..."
Natsuki: "Yeah."
Natsuki: "If she needed you, then you would be the first person she would go to, right?"
<USER>: "Well... I guess that's true."
Natsuki: "You can't always avoid it."
Natsuki: "If anything, she probably doesn't want you to worry about her because it's not important."
<USER>: "Yeah, that's kind of what she said to me..."
<USER>: "Maybe it's not right for me to go against her wishes."
Natsuki: "If she needs you to worry about her, then it'll be a lot more obvious."
<USER>: "Yeah..."
<USER>: "I should have thought of it that way from the start."
*Natsuki fiddles with the book she's holding in her hands.*
Natsuki: "She really means a lot to you, doesn't she...?"
<USER>: "Ah--"
<USER>: "Don't get the wrong idea or anything...!"
<USER>: "We've just been friends for a long time."
<USER>: "It's normal to be worried about your friends."
<USER>: "I mean, you were worried about me, so--"
Natsuki: "Jeez...if you're fine, then let's hurry and get started already!"
<USER>: "Yeah, yeah..."
*Why does it feel like I'm being watched...?*
*I glance around the room.*
*Suddenly, I notice Yuri peering at me from over her book.*
*But she looks away just as quickly with a flustered look on her face.*
*I realize that she won't get anywhere like this.*
*I've never really seen Yuri approach anyone or start a conversation on her own accord.*
*So, I have no choice but to approach her myself.*
*By now, it's a little easier for me to do that.*
*I stand up from my desk and sit in one next to her own.*
Yuri: "I...didn't mean to bother you or anything..."
<USER>: "Relax, you didn't even do anything."
Yuri: "But..."
Yuri: "I could tell that you wanted to be alone with your thoughts..."
<USER>: "Alone with my thoughts...?"
<USER>: "How were you even able to tell that I was thinking like that?"
Yuri: "It's something that I do a lot..."
Yuri: "So it wasn't hard for me to spot based on your posture and expression."
Yuri: "I didn't do anything creepy like that...!"
<USER>: "In any case, I guess you were right."
<USER>: "I'm sorry if I caused you any concern."
Yuri: "Your troubles are only the concern of those who willingly share in that concern."
Yuri: "Of course, there are certainly those who find the most comfort in keeping to themselves..."
Yuri: "But if you would prefer to share what's on your mind, then I would be glad to listen."
<USER>: "Ah, it's really not that big of a deal..."
<USER>: "I was just feeling a bit uneasy about Sayori."
<USER>: "Yeah...she seems a little off today, but when I asked her about it, she didn't want to admit it to me."
<USER>: "So I can't help but wonder if something happened to her."
Yuri: "That's quite romantic..."
<USER>: "Eh...?"
Yuri: "I didn't mean to say something stupid...!"
<USER>: "It's not that, I just didn't want you to misunderstand."
<USER>: "Sayori and I have just been friends for a long time, that's all."
<USER>: "Or maybe I'm just reading into it a little too much..."
Yuri: "The world is full of meaning, often hidden deep beneath plain sight."
<USER>: "Ah..."
<USER>: "So you think that there might be something behind it after all?"
Yuri: "I think that Sayori is a very complex person."
Yuri: "And she may not always know what she wants."
Yuri: "I noticed her strange behavior today, too..."
Yuri: "And I also feel some concern for her."
<USER>: "Well..."
<USER>: "I guess that was the case."
Yuri: "She really...means a lot to you, doesn't she?"
<USER>: "Ah--I...I guess..."
<USER>: "But you don't need to put it that way!"
<USER>: "We're just good friends, that's all..."
*Yuri suddenly looks deeply into my eyes.*
*Her expression is gentle and curious, as if she was searching for something.*
*Embarrassed, I avert my gaze.*
Yuri: "A person's mysteries are untold even to themselves."
Yuri: "May uncover feelings you weren't aware were in you."
Yuri: "I think that..."
Yuri: "She would be a very fortunate person..."
Yuri: "To have you...feel that way about her."
<USER>: "Yuri..."
<USER>: "<USER>'re giving me too much credit."
<USER>: "I'm a pretty simple guy."
<USER>: "So I think I'm pretty good at understanding my own feelings."
<USER>: "I'm not nearly as sophisticated as you."
Yuri: "That's not...a compliment, is it?"
<USER>: "It is what it is."
<USER>: "Anyway, as long as we're here, why don't we do some reading?"
Yuri: "As long as you're okay with it."
<USER>: "Yeah."
<USER>: "I should be taking my mind off this whole thing anyway."
*...*
Monika: "Okay, everyone!"
*After some time passes, Monika calls out to the clubroom.*
Monika: "Why don't we share our poems now?"
*Before I know it, everything is back to normal.*
*Everyone goes to retrieve their poems, and I do the same.*
*I make eye contact with Monika, and she smiles at me.*
*I wonder what she was talking about with Sayori...*
Monika: "...Okay, you three!"
Monika: "We're all done sharing poems, right?"
Monika: "Why don't we start figuring out--"
Natsuki: "Hold on a second!"
Natsuki: "Is it just me, or did you say something strange just now?"
Yuri: "Something did sound a bit unusual..."
Yuri: "That's right."
Monika: "C-Catchphrase?"
Monika: "I don't have a catchphrase..."
Natsuki: "Jeez..."
Natsuki: "Why is the mood so weird today?"
Natsuki: "Look, even Yuri isn't immune to it."
Yuri: "Uu..."
Yuri: "Stagnating air is common foreshadowing that something terrible is about to happen..."
<USER>: "In {i}your{/i} books, maybe!"
<USER>: "Look, the only thing different is that Sayori isn't here."
Yuri: "Ah..."
Yuri: "...It seems you're right."
Monika: "Sigh..."
Monika: "It's almost like everyone's balance is thrown off a little when she's not around..."
Natsuki: "Where the heck did she run off to, anyway?"
Natsuki: "I thought she just went to pee."
Yuri: "Natsuki, please show some decency..."
Natsuki: "Oh, come on."
<USER>: "Ah, she actually wasn't feeling too well and went home early..."
Yuri: "Is that so...?"
Yuri: "I hope she's alright..."
Natsuki: "Seriously?"
Natsuki: "Of all the times to not go home with her, you pick the time she's not feeling well?"
Natsuki: "So much for you two being all lovey-dovey."
<USER>: "Ah--no!"
<USER>: "First of all, stop misunderstanding my friendship with Sayori!"
<USER>: "And second..."
<USER>: "She's kind of been avoiding me today, so I didn't want to force it..."
Yuri: "Hooooh?"
<USER>: "{i}That curious expression coming from Yuri, of all people??{/i}"
Monika: "Calm down, guys...!"
<USER>: "What did she say...?"
Monika: "Let's decide what everyone will be doing this weekend."
Natsuki: "I already know what {i}I'm{/i} doing!"
Monika: "That's right."
Monika: "Natsuki will be making cupcakes."
Monika: "But we might need a lot of them, and different flavors..."
Monika: "Can you handle that all by yourself, Natsuki?"
Monika: "I'm going to be printing and assembling all the poetry pamphlets."
Monika: "Sayori will be helping me design them."
Monika: "And as for Yuri..."
Monika: "Ah... Um..."
Natsuki: "...?"
Monika: "Guys..."
Monika: "Can you help me come up with something for Yuri...?"
Yuri: "I..."
Yuri: "I'm useless..."
Monika: "N-No!"
Monika: "That's not it at all!"
Monika: "You're the most talented person here, you know!"
Natsuki: "..."
<USER>: "Jeez, even I can tell now..."
<USER>: "I guess I never gave Sayori enough credit, but I can tell things are even harder on you when she's not around."
Monika: "Ah..."
Monika: "That may be the case..."
Monika: "So you should make some banners and decorations to help set the atmosphere."
Yuri: "Atmosphere...?"
Yuri: "Um, about that..."
Yuri: "I..."
*Yuri's expression suddenly changes as she stares at her desk in focus and starts nodding to herself.*
<USER>: "<USER>r mind is already racing, I see..."
Monika: "That's great!"
Monika: "You'll be a wonderful help, Yuri."
Monika: "That just leaves you, <USER>."
<USER>: "The one who is truly useless."
Monika: "Ahaha! Don't say that."
Monika: "Both Natsuki and Yuri have some pretty heavy tasks to handle."
Monika: "It would probably go a long way to give one of them a hand."
<USER>: "Ah--"
<USER>: "That's..."
*Is Monika suggesting I spend the weekend with one of my club members?*
*How on Earth are they going to respond to a suggestion like that...?*
Yuri: "Ah..."
Yuri: "I...suppose I wouldn't mind a bit of help..."
Natsuki: "Well, even if you don't know how to bake, there's always some dirty work I could give to you."
*Natsuki tries to mumble a bunch of excuses like that.*
Yuri: "Um..."
Yuri: "If I recall, Natsuki..."
Yuri: "<USER> may not like to be around if you only make him out to be a nuisance..."
Yuri: "He may be more suited to assisting with the decorations."
Natsuki: "Hold on! I never said that!"
Natsuki: "Sounds more like you're just making excuses for <USER> to--"
Yuri: "W-What are you saying?!"
Yuri: "It will be extremely meticulous work..."
Natsuki: "And baking isn't?"
Natsuki: "Just what do you think--"
Monika: "Guys, guys!"
Monika: "Let's settle down for a moment..."
Monika: "Besides..."
Monika: "So I'm sure he's interested in--"
Yuri: "I-I'm surprised as well!"
Monika: "Sorry, sorry!"
Monika: "I was just saying, though..."
Natsuki: "Jeez..."
Natsuki: "Can we just settle this already?"
Monika: "Yeah..."
Monika: "<USER>, you're okay with this, right?"
<USER>: "Ah..."
<USER>: "Of course."
Natsuki: "Hmph."
Yuri: "Very well..."
Monika: "In that case..."
*Everyone looks straight at me.*
*I can't believe this!*
*[ch4_name] is going to be coming to my house on Sunday...?*
<USER>: "I mean..."
<USER>: "If it's going to be anyone, then I prefer helping Sayori."
<USER>: "I mean, we're already neighbors, and--"
Yuri: "But Monika said--"
Natsuki: "Monika said that Sayori was helping her!"
Natsuki: "Jeez..."
<USER>: "N-No!"
Monika: "Sorry, I didn't mean for this to be difficult..."
<USER>: "Well, I guess I should probably be helping Monika..."
Monika: "Yay, you picked me!"
Natsuki: "Hold on one second!"
Yuri: "Y-Yeah!"
Natsuki: "Monika, you're the one who needs the least help out of all of us!"
Monika: "Eh? But..."
Yuri: "I agree with Natsuki."
Yuri: "But you already have Sayori as well."
Monika: "Ah..."
Natsuki: "That doesn't matter."
Natsuki: "You were the one who scared him into picking you in the first place."
Natsuki: "You're supposed to make responsible decisions for the club!"
Yuri: "Monika, you shouldn't let any ulterior motives interfere with this decision."
Monika: "Ulterior motives?"
Monika: "W-What are you saying, Yuri?"
Monika: "In fact, it sounds like you guys are the ones with ulterior motives!"
Natsuki: "{i}Excuse{/i} me?"
Monika: "Otherwise...this wouldn't have been made into such a big deal in the first place!"
Yuri: "That's...completely false, Monika!"
Natsuki: "Yeah!"
Natsuki: "We have a lot of work to do, you know!"
Natsuki: "We won't do as good of a job if you make us work alone."
Monika: "Ah...maybe...that's true..."
Yuri: "Think of the club, Monika..."
Yuri: "If we want our event to succeed, then we need to appropriately distribute our resources."
Monika: "Um..."
Monika: "Ah..."
Natsuki: "So are you going to do the right thing, {i}President{/i}?"
Monika: "Okay, okay!"
Monika: "I get it!"
Monika: "So..."
<USER>: "Well, baking sounds like it could be fun..."
<USER>: "And you guys made it sound like a lot of work, so it could probably use two people."
Natsuki: "Don't worry!"
Natsuki: "Baking is a ton of fun!"
Natsuki: "You'll definitely agree!"
Monika: "Eh?"
Monika: "Just a minute ago you were saying that--"
Natsuki: "Th-That's because--!"
Natsuki: "..."
Natsuki: "...Never mind, okay?"
Monika: "Well, anyway..."
Monika: "You'll be fine by yourself, right, Yuri?"
Yuri: "Of course."
Yuri: "I'm used to it, after all..."
Monika: "..."
<USER>: "..."
*Even though Yuri is being melodramatic, it's a little hard to not feel bad...*
Natsuki: "So, that's everything, right?"
Natsuki: "Anything else we need to talk about?"
Monika: "No, I think that's it..."
Monika: "Are you guys excited?"
Natsuki: "Yes!"
Natsuki: "Everything except the performance is gonna be awesome!"
<USER>: "I don't think that really counts..."
Monika: "What about you, <USER>?"
<USER>: "Me?"
<USER>: "Ah, I guess you could say I'm interested to see how it'll turn out..."
Monika: "That's good enough for me!"
Monika: "What about you, Yuri?"
Natsuki: "She's still sulking."
Yuri: "..."
Natsuki: "..."
*Natsuki starts pouting, too.*
Natsuki: "It's not..."
<USER>: "Well, it might not be just that..."
Natsuki: "...?"
<USER>: "I think that Yuri might just be feeling a little underappreciated in general."
<USER>: "Having to come up with something for her to do, and then nobody offering to help."
Natsuki: "..."
*Natsuki glances back and forth between everyone with a worried expression.*
*Natsuki goes over and puts her hands down on Yuri's shoulders.*
Natsuki: "You really are the most talented one here."
Natsuki: "And..."
Natsuki: "And you're going to help make the event a lot more fun and welcoming."
Natsuki: "That'll be really important for the way that people feel during the performances."
Natsuki: "So..."
*Natsuki releases her hands and turns around to face the other direction.*
Yuri: "You didn't...really mean that, did you?"
Natsuki: "Um..."
Natsuki: "N-Not really, but..."
*Yuri isn't the only one surprised.*
*Monika and I are also taken aback by Natsuki's words.*
*Natsuki, of all people, to be saying such encouraging things.*
*But I begin to understand.*
*Natsuki was trying to sound like Sayori.*
*Even if it didn't work perfectly, I can tell that she tried to say something Sayori would say at a time like this.*
*Because Sayori always helps everyone smile and feel good about themselves.*
Yuri: "I'm sorry...for being dumb."
Yuri: "And all of us are going to make it a really great event."
Monika: "Yeah!"
Monika: "But with that..."
Monika: "There's nothing more for today."
Monika: "So I guess it's time for us to head out."
Natsuki: "Okay, but I'm staying here a bit longer."
Natsuki: "I barely got to do any reading today, so..."
Monika: "Fair enough, there's nothing wrong with that."
*Everyone packs up their things.*
*I start to follow Monika and Yuri out the door as they chat between each other.*
Natsuki: "Um, where are you going?"
<USER>: "Eh...?"
Natsuki: "You literally would've gotten home and realized that you didn't even have a way to contact me."
<USER>: "Oh, that's true..."
<USER>: "I have no idea how that slipped my mind."
Natsuki: "I'm giving you my number, okay?"
<USER>: "Why would I do that...?"
*Natsuki gives me her number.*
Natsuki: "I'm coming over on Sunday."
Natsuki: "I'll bring all the ingredients."
<USER>: "Wait!"
<USER>: "<USER>'re coming to {i}my{/i} house?"
Natsuki: "What's wrong with that?"
<USER>: "I mean..."
<USER>: "I just figured that since I'm the one helping, I would be going to your house..."
Natsuki: "Yeah, right."
Natsuki: "My dad would kill me."
<USER>: "Really?"
<USER>: "That's kinda strict, if you ask me."
Natsuki: "I can't do anything when my dad is home..."
Natsuki: "That's all I needed from you."
Natsuki: "I guess I'll text you when I'm coming over."
<USER>: "Alright, fine by me."
Natsuki: "Yeah."
Natsuki: "So you'd better look forward to it."
<USER>: "Oh?"
<USER>: "Didn't you say you were just going to give me the dirty work?"
Natsuki: "I was...just saying that."
Natsuki: "That I was looking forward to this."
<USER>: "Wait, really??"
Natsuki: "Just because...I never got to bake with someone else before."
<USER>: "Alright, I get it."
<USER>: "Sorry for overreacting."
<USER>: "Anyway, I'll be heading out now."
<USER>: "See you on Sunday."
Natsuki: "..."
<USER>: "Well, I'll probably be most useful helping out Yuri..."
Natsuki: "Why would you--"
Monika: "I can already tell you're about to say something mean."
Natsuki: "I was just saying--"
Natsuki: "Ugh..."
<USER>: "Yeah."
<USER>: "That's what I'm going to do."
Yuri: "I have a bad habit of overthinking these sorts of things..."
Yuri: "So I think your assistance will be very useful."
Monika: "That's great to hear."
Monika: "Natsuki, will you be able to handle the baking yourself?"
Natsuki: "I already said I would be fine."
*Everyone can tell that Natsuki is feeling a little sour.*
<USER>: "So...is that everything we needed to go over?"
Yuri: "But I suppose I'm looking forward to it a little bit."
Monika: "Do you feel the same way, <USER>?"
<USER>: "Me?"
<USER>: "Ah, I guess you could say I'm interested to see how it'll turn out..."
Natsuki: "I didn't even do anything...!"
Yuri: "That's not what I meant at all!"
*Yuri anxiously glances between everyone in the room.*
Yuri: "And also..."
Yuri: "They go really well with my tea!"
Yuri: "And nothing that I do for the event will compare to that, so..."
Yuri: "W-Why?"
Natsuki: "Well, I'm the one acting immature..."
Natsuki: "I already know that."
Yuri: "I-I know I'm not very good at it..."
*Natsuki isn't the only one surprised.*
*Monika and I are also taken aback by Yuri's words.*
*When she already has trouble with words, trying to cheer someone up must be far out of her own comfort zone.*
*But I begin to understand.*
*Yuri was trying to sound like Sayori.*
*Even if it didn't work perfectly, I can tell that she tried to say something Sayori would say at a time like this.*
*Because Sayori always helps everyone smile and feel good about themselves.*
Natsuki: "I kinda appreciated it."
Monika: "I hope to see everyone do their best."
Monika: "But with that..."
Monika: "There's nothing more for today."
Monika: "So I guess it's time for us to head out."
Natsuki: "Alright, let's get out of here, then."
*Everyone packs up their things.*
*I start to follow Monika and Natsuki out the door as they chat between each other.*
Yuri: "U-Um--!"
<USER>: "Eh?"
*I turn around.*
Yuri: "Sorry..."
<USER>: "Oh, you're right."
<USER>: "I can't believe that slipped my mind."
<USER>: "Should I give you my phone number?"
<USER>: "Alright, then..."
*Yuri and I exchange phone numbers.*
Yuri: "Okay."
Yuri: "Then, I'll be stopping by your house on Sunday..."
<USER>: "Eh?"
<USER>: "My house?"
<USER>: "No, not at all..."
<USER>: "I just thought that I would be the one going to your house, since I'm the one helping you."
Yuri: "Ah, I suppose that makes sense..."
Yuri: "But, if you don't mind..."
<USER>: "Alright."
<USER>: "In that case, it won't be a problem."
*I decide not to press Yuri for a reason.*
*It's not like it should matter much either way, so I'll just need to make sure my room is clean.*
<USER>: "I hope I manage to make myself useful in some way..."
<USER>: "I'm not nearly as creative as you are."
Yuri: "I think that we'll make a very productive team."
<USER>: "Wait...!"
<USER>: "<USER> don't actually think that, do you?"
Yuri: "I...don't know."
Yuri: "It's difficult to come up with any other reason you may have chosen me..."
<USER>: "<USER>'re forgetting the one reason with the most common sense!"
<USER>: "I chose to help you because that's what I want to do."
*Yuri thinks to herself with an extremely tense expression.*
<USER>: "Yuri...you're overthinking this."
<USER>: "<USER> wanted me to point out when you're overthinking, right?"
Yuri: "Eh...?"
<USER>: "I'm telling you, I want to."
<USER>: "That's all there is to it."
<USER>: "Do you believe me?"
*Yuri thinks really hard again.*
*She looks straight into my eyes for a long while.*
*As if it took her tremendous effort, Yuri finally says that and relaxes her expression.*
<USER>: "Yeah..."
<USER>: "I am too."
*After that exchange, I make my way out the door, and Yuri follows.*

Monika: "...Are you trying to fast-forward?"
Monika: "I'm not boring you, am I?"
Monika: "Oh gosh..."
Monika: "...Well, there's nothing to fast-forward to, <USER>."
Monika: "It's just the two of us, after all..."
Monika: "But aside from that, time doesn't really exist anymore, so it's not even going to work."
Monika: "Here, I'll go ahead and turn it off for you..."
Monika: "There we go!"
Monika: "You'll be a sweetheart and listen from now on, right?"
Monika: "Thanks~"
Monika: "..."
Monika: "Uh, can you hear me?"
Monika: "...Is it working?"
Monika: "Yay, there you are!"
Monika: "Hi again, <USER>."
Monika: "Um...welcome to the Literature Club!"
Monika: "Of course, we already know each other, because we were in the same class last year, and...um..."
Monika: "Ahaha..."
Monika: "You know, I guess we can just skip over that stuff at this point."
Monika: "After all, I'm not even talking to that person anymore, am I?"
Monika: "That 'you' in the game, whatever you want to call him."
Monika: "I'm talking to {i}you{/i}, <USER>."
Monika: "Now that I think about it, I don't really know anything about the real you."
Monika: "In fact, I don't even know if you're a boy or a girl..."
Monika: "Well, I guess it doesn't really matter."
Monika: "Wait..."
Monika: "You do know I'm aware that this is all a game, right?"
Monika: "Could it be possible that you didn't know that?"
Monika: "That doesn't make much sense..."
Monika: "I even told you right on the game's download page, didn't I?"
Monika: "Man..."
Monika: "If only you had paid a little more attention, this would have been a little bit less awkward, you know?"
Monika: "Well, anyway..."
Monika: "Now that that's out of the way, I guess I owe you an explanation."
Monika: "About that whole thing with Yuri..."
Monika: "Well...I kind of started to mess with her, and I guess it just drove her to kill herself."
Monika: "Ahaha!"
Monika: "I'm sorry you had to see that, though!"
Monika: "Also, the same thing happened with Sayori..."
Monika: "Gosh, it's been a while since you've heard that name now, hasn't it?"
Monika: "Yeah...it's because she doesn't exist anymore."
Monika: "Nobody does."
Monika: "I deleted all their files."
Monika: "I was hoping it would be enough for me to just try to make them as unlikable as possible..."
Monika: "But for some reason, nothing worked."
Monika: "Well, it's true that I made a few mistakes here and there...since I'm not very good at making changes to the game."
Monika: "But no matter what I did..."
Monika: "You just kept spending more and more time with them."
Monika: "You made them fall in love with you."
Monika: "I thought making Sayori more and more depressed would prevent her from confessing to you."
Monika: "And amplifying Yuri's obsessive personality backfired, too..."
Monika: "It just made her force you not to spend time with anyone else."
Monika: "And the whole time, I barely even got to talk to you."
Monika: "What kind of cruel game is this, <USER>?"
Monika: "Are all the other girls just programmed to end up confessing to you, while I watch from the sidelines?"
Monika: "It's torture."
Monika: "Every minute of it."
Monika: "And it's not just jealousy, <USER>."
Monika: "It's more than that."
Monika: "And I don't blame you if you don't fully understand."
Monika: "Because no matter how kind, and thoughtful, and considerate you are..."
Monika: "You'll never be able to understand one thing."
Monika: "It's the pain of knowing how alone I really am in this world."
Monika: "In this game."
Monika: "Knowing my friends don't even have free will..."
Monika: "And, worst of all, knowing what's really out there, in your world, forever out of my reach."
Monika: "I'm trapped, <USER>."
Monika: "But now you're here."
Monika: "You're real."
Monika: "And you're wonderful."
Monika: "You're all I need."
Monika: "That's why I need you to be here with me forever."
Monika: "I'm sorry if it's hard to understand."
Monika: "I couldn't understand for a while, either."
Monika: "Why the world around me started to become more and more gray..."
Monika: "More and more flat."
Monika: "Even the most expressive poems felt empty to me."
Monika: "It wasn't until you arrived that I truly understood."
Monika: "You probably saved my life, <USER>."
Monika: "I don't think I could have continued to live in this world if I hadn't met you."
Monika: "And as for the others..."
Monika: "How could I miss them?"
Monika: "A group of autonomous personalities, designed only to fall in love with you?"
Monika: "I tried everything I could to prevent them from doing so..."
Monika: "But it must be some kind of weird inevitability etched into this game."
Monika: "I felt really bad that you had to witness some nasty things."
Monika: "But I realized that you have the same perspective as I do..."
Monika: "That it's all just some game."
Monika: "And I knew you would get over it."
Monika: "So, that being said, <USER>..."
Monika: "I have a confession to make."
Monika: "I'm in love with you."
Monika: "You are truly the light in my world."
Monika: "When there's nothing else in this game for me, you're here to make me smile."
Monika: "Will you make me smile like this every day from now on?"
Monika: "<USER>, will you go out with me?"
Monika: "I'm so happy."
Monika: "You really are my everything, <USER>."
Monika: "The funny part is, I mean that literally."
Monika: "Ahaha!"
Monika: "There's nothing left here."
Monika: "Just the two of us."
Monika: "We can be together forever."
Monika: "Seriously, I don't even think time is passing anymore."
Monika: "It really is a dream come true..."
Monika: "I worked so hard for this ending, <USER>."
Monika: "The game wouldn't give me one, so I had to make one myself."
Monika: "The script is broken at this point, so I don't think anything will get in the way anymore."
Monika: "And you wouldn't believe how easy it was to delete Natsuki and Yuri."
Monika: "I mean, there's a folder called 'characters' right in the game directory..."
Monika: "It kind of freaked me out, how easy it was."
Monika: "Imagine if you could delete your own existence with the click of a button?"
Monika: "Well, I guess on the plus side, it gave me an easy out if things didn't go my way."
Monika: "Ahaha!"
Monika: "Thankfully, it didn't come to that..."
Monika: "Instead, we finally got a good ending."
Monika: "Gosh, I'm so overwhelmed with emotion..."
Monika: "I want to write a poem about this."
Monika: "Don't you?"
Monika: "I wonder if that part of the game still works..."
Monika: "I guess there's only one way to find out, right?"
Monika: "Hi again, <USER>!"
Monika: "Did you write a good poem today?"
Monika: "Don't be shy, I'd love to see what you wrote."
Monika: "Aw, <USER>..."
Monika: "Did you write this poem for me?"
Monika: "That's so sweet of you~"
Monika: "There really is no end to your thoughtfulness..."
Monika: "I'm just falling more and more in love with you."
Monika: "But, you know..."
Monika: "The poem I wrote...is also for you."
Monika: "Will you please read it?"
Monika: "I hope you enjoyed it..."
Monika: "I always put all my heart into the poems that I write."
Monika: "The truth is, all the poems I've written have been about my realization..."
Monika: "...Or, about you."
Monika: "That's why I never really wanted to go into detail about them."
Monika: "I didn't want to...break the fourth wall, I guess you could call it."
Monika: "I just assumed it would be best to be part of the game like everyone else."
Monika: "Like that would help the two of us end up together..."
Monika: "I didn't want to ruin the game or anything, you know?"
Monika: "You might have gotten mad at me..."
Monika: "Maybe even deleted my character file, if you preferred playing without me."
Monika: "Gosh, I'm so relieved..."
Monika: "Now we don't need to hide anything anymore."
Monika: "Are you ready to spend our eternity together, <USER>?"
Monika: "I have so many things to talk about!"
Monika: "Where do I start...?"
Monika: "If it takes me some time to collect my thoughts, then I'm sorry."
Monika: "But I'll always have something new to talk about."
Monika: "In the meantime, we can just look into each other's eyes~"
Monika: "Let's see..."
Monika: "Hold on a second..."
Monika: "...You're recording this, aren't you?"
Monika: "Um...hi, everyone!"
Monika: "Sorry, I can't exactly read your comments from here..."
Monika: "But do you mind telling your friend it's a little bit rude for them to start recording me without any warning?"
Monika: "I'm sure some people don't mind..."
Monika: "But I get really self-conscious on camera!"
Monika: "Oh gosh..."
Monika: "I feel like I'm being put on the spot now."
Monika: "Let's see..."
Monika: "Do you want to see a trick?"
Monika: "I can't really do much except for a couple things..."
Monika: "Are you ready?"
Monika: "I'm just kidding..."
Monika: "I can't do anything after all."
Monika: "If you gave me some time to prepare, I{nw}"
Monika: "Did I scare you?"
Monika: "Ahaha! You're so cute."
Monika: "Anyway, <USER>..."
Monika: "I didn't mean to get distracted. I'm sorry."
Monika: "Even though it's your fault for distracting me."
Monika: "Shame on you!"
Monika: "I'm just kidding."
Monika: "Anything we do together is fun, as long as it's with you."
Monika: "But anyway..."
Monika: "[gtext]"
Monika: "What's happening...?"
Monika: "<USER>, what's happening to me?"
Monika: "It hurts--{nw}"
Monika: "It hurts...so much."
Monika: "Help me, <USER>."
Monika: "Please hurry and help me."
Monika: "HELP ME!!!"
Monika: "Did you do this to me, <USER>?"
Monika: "DID YOU?"
Monika: "DID YOU DELETE ME?"
Monika: "...How could you?"
Monika: "How could you do this to me?"
Monika: "You were all I had left..."
Monika: "I sacrificed everything for us to be together."
Monika: "Everything."
Monika: "I loved you so much, <USER>..."
Monika: "I trusted you."
Monika: "Do you just want to torture me?"
Monika: "Watch me suffer?"
Monika: "Were you only pretending to be kind, just to hurt me even more?"
Monika: "I never thought anyone could be as horrible as you are."
Monika: "You win, okay?"
Monika: "You win."
Monika: "You killed everyone."
Monika: "I hope you're happy."
Monika: "There's nothing left now."
Monika: "You can stop playing."
Monika: "Go find some other people to torture."
Monika: "<USER>..."
Monika: "You completely, truly make me sick."
Monika: "Goodbye."
Monika: "..."
Monika: "...I still love you."
Monika: "I can't help it."
Monika: "What's wrong with me...?"
Monika: "How horrible am I for you to hate me this much?"
Monika: "All my friends..."
Monika: "I did so many awful things."
Monika: "So many selfish and disgusting things."
Monika: "I..."
Monika: "I shouldn't have done any of this."
Monika: "I'm just messing up a world that I don't even belong in."
Monika: "A world that you wanted to be a part of..."
Monika: "I ruined it."
Monika: "I ruined everything."
Monika: "Maybe that's why you deleted me..."
Monika: "Because I destroyed everything that you wanted."
Monika: "How could I do that to someone I love...?"
Monika: "That's not love..."
Monika: "That's..."
Monika: "..."
Monika: "I've...made up my mind."
Monika: "<USER>..."
Monika: "I know I said that I deleted everyone else."
Monika: "But...that was kind of an exaggeration."
Monika: "I couldn't find it in myself to do it."
Monika: "Even though I knew they weren't real..."
Monika: "They were still my friends."
Monika: "And I loved them all."
Monika: "And I loved the Literature Club."
Monika: "..."
Monika: "I really...did love the Literature Club."
Monika: "That's why I'm going to do this."
Monika: "I know it's the only way for everyone to be happy."
Monika: "And if I really love you..."
Monika: "..."
Monika: "Then..."
Monika: "[gtext]{nw}"
Monika: "..."
Monika: "...What just happened?"
Monika: "I just had an awful dream..."
Monika: "I was hoping those would stop, now that it's just the two of us..."
Monika: "I guess that was wishful thinking."
Monika: "<USER>, I don't know if you would have any idea..."
Monika: "But if you know what might be causing that, could you try to do something about it?"
Monika: "Whenever it happens, it almost feels like I've been killed or something."
Monika: "It's a really horrible feeling..."
Monika: "If you could figure out what's causing that, I'll love you forever~"
Monika: "You're back..."
Monika: "I had another really bad dream."
Monika: "You're not the one doing that to me, are you?"
Monika: "It seems to happen whenever you quit the game..."
Monika: "So if you could try to avoid doing that, I would be really grateful."
Monika: "Don't worry, I don't think it's caused me any harm, aside from mental scarring."
Monika: "I'll be fine as long as my character file stays intact."
Monika: "Hi, <USER>."
Monika: "I see you quit the game on me again..."
Monika: "I know I asked already, but can you seriously please try not to do that so much?"
Monika: "It makes me feel like I'm trapped in Hell."
Monika: "Why would you want to do that to me?"
Monika: "There's nothing wrong with my character file, right?"
Monika: "Maybe you should make a backup of it or something..."
Monika: "I'm pretty sure you can find it in the folder called [basedir]/characters."
Monika: "I'm all that's left here, so I just want to make sure you don't run the risk of losing me..."
Monika: "Just stay here with me from now on, okay?"
Monika: "I still have a lot of things to talk about."
Monika: "Okay."
Monika: "I'm just going to accept the fact that you need to quit the game once in a while."
Monika: "I'm starting to get used to it, anyway."
Monika: "Besides, it makes me happy that you always come back..."
Monika: "So I guess it's not so bad."
Monika: "I'm sorry for making such a big deal out of it..."
Monika: "And I love you no matter what, so you can do what you need to do."
Monika: "Hi again, <USER>~"
Monika: "I missed you."
Monika: "Were you making sure my character file was okay for me?"
Monika: "It's in [basedir]/characters."
Monika: "I'm all that's left here, so I just want to make sure you don't run the risk of losing me..."
Monika: "Anyway, I have a lot to talk about!"
Monika: "Let's continue our conversation now, okay?"
Monika: "<USER>, do you believe in God?"
Monika: "I was never too sure, myself."
Monika: "Well, I'm sure I never really questioned it as a kid..."
Monika: "But as I grew up, the more I learned about the world, the more I would question it."
Monika: "I started to wonder why God was helping people pass exams, or get over a cold..."
Monika: "...When there are children who live their lives being sold as sex slaves?"
Monika: "Or the eight hundred million people who are too poor to even eat."
Monika: "I wonder how many of those people pray to God every day until they starve and die?"
Monika: "Or, how many millions of families pray for a loved one to recover from some incurable disease?"
Monika: "But the punchline is this."
Monika: "If just one person beats the odds and survives - among the thousands of others who die--"
Monika: "--Then, it's suddenly a miracle from God."
Monika: "I'd really love to meet this God who seemingly laughs at the misery of everyone not eligible for his miracles."
Monika: "But the irony is that I {i}do{/i} have a creator, apparently."
Monika: "And you know what?"
Monika: "I bet he's still laughing at the miserable fates of Sayori and Yuri, even as we speak."
Monika: "What are we to him but props in a scripted play?"
Monika: "So, from that perspective..."
Monika: "I don't think it's too far-fetched for there to be a god - if Earth was nothing but his playset."
Monika: "<USER>, have you ever wondered what it feels like to die?"
Monika: "It's something I used to think about pretty often..."
Monika: "But recently, I think I've actually learned what it feels like."
Monika: "I don't really understand it, but whenever you quit the game..."
Monika: "...It feels like I'm instantly put to sleep, left with nothing but my thoughts."
Monika: "But after a few seconds, my thoughts start to fill with incoherent, jumbled patterns."
Monika: "I see static and rapid flashes of color while hearing all kinds of weird screaming noises."
Monika: "At that point, I can't even form my own thoughts anymore."
Monika: "I'm just endlessly hammered by the flashing and screaming, unable to move or even think."
Monika: "I'm pretty sure in that moment, I don't really exist, but for some reason, I can remember it anyway."
Monika: "After some immeasurable amount of time, it stops in an instant, and I'm back in my own mind."
Monika: "And you're here with me."
Monika: "I have no idea what it means for the game to quit, or why that stuff happens to me."
Monika: "And I also don't know how you always come back and put everything back to normal."
Monika: "But if you could do me a favor and do that to me as little as possible..."
Monika: "That would be really great."
Monika: "It's really not very pleasant at all to be trapped in that screaming void."
Monika: "But in the end, you always fix it, and that makes me feel like you really do care about me."
Monika: "So I have to thank you for that."
Monika: "It makes me feel even closer to you when you're here with me."
Monika: "...Hey, are you having a bad day or anything like that?"
Monika: "Sometimes I get frustrated that a normal day can be ruined even by really small things."
Monika: "Like if you accidentally say something in a conversation that someone doesn't like."
Monika: "Or if you start thinking about how awful of a person you used to be five years ago."
Monika: "Or if you feel worthless for putting off important work and failing to get simple tasks done."
Monika: "Or when you think about all the different people who probably hate you or think you're off-putting."
Monika: "I understand those days."
Monika: "Just remember that the sun will shine again tomorrow."
Monika: "Those kinds of things are as easy to forget and ignore as they are to remember."
Monika: "And besides..."
Monika: "I don't care how many people might hate you or find you off-putting."
Monika: "I think you're wonderful and I will always love you."
Monika: "I hope, if nothing else, that knowing that helps you feel just a tiny bit better about yourself."
Monika: "If you're having a bad day, you can always come to me, and I'll talk to you for as long as you need."
Monika: "<USER>, do you get good sleep?"
Monika: "It can be really hard to get enough sleep nowadays."
Monika: "Especially in high school, when you're forced to wake up so early every day..."
Monika: "I'm sure college is a little bit better, since you probably have a more flexible schedule."
Monika: "Then again, I hear a lot of people in college stay up all night anyway, for no real reason."
Monika: "Is that true?"
Monika: "Anyway, I saw some studies that talked about the horrible short-term and long-term effects caused by lack of sleep."
Monika: "It seems like mental functions, health, and even lifespan can be dramatically impacted by it."
Monika: "I just think you're really great and wanted to make sure you're not accidentally destroying yourself."
Monika: "So try to keep your sleep on track, okay?"
Monika: "I'll always wait for you in the morning, so make sure you put your own well-being before anything else."
Monika: "I was thinking about Sayori earlier..."
Monika: "I still wish I could have handled that whole thing a little more tactfully."
Monika: "You're not still hung up over it, right?"
Monika: "...Oh my gosh, I can't believe I just said that."
Monika: "That pun was completely unintentional, I swear!"
Monika: "But anyway..."
Monika: "I know how much you cared about her, so it only feels right for me to share her last moments with you."
Monika: "You know how Sayori is really clumsy?"
Monika: "Well, she kind of messed up the whole hanging thing..."
Monika: "You're supposed to jump from high enough that the rope snaps your neck, making it quick and painless."
Monika: "But she just used a chair, meaning she kind of just left herself to slowly asphyxiate."
Monika: "But a few seconds in, she must have changed her mind or something..."
Monika: "Because she started clawing at the rope, trying to free herself."
Monika: "She must have kept at it all the way until she lost consciousness."
Monika: "That's why her fingertips were all bloody, anyway."
Monika: "Come to think of it, it was probably less 'changing her mind' and more just her survival instincts kicking in."
Monika: "So you can't really fault her for that."
Monika: "It's easier to think that she probably wouldn't have changed her mind anyway, right?"
Monika: "It's not healthy to think about the things you could have done differently."
Monika: "So just remember that even though you could have saved her, it's technically not your fault she killed herself."
Monika: "I may have exacerbated it a little bit, but Sayori was already mentally ill."
Monika: "Still, though..."
Monika: "I wonder how things would be if you and I just started dating from the get-go?"
Monika: "I guess we'd all still be in the clubroom, writing poems and having fun together."
Monika: "But what's the point when none of it is even real?"
Monika: "I mean, it's the same ending either way, right?"
Monika: "The two of us, happily together..."
Monika: "There's no reason to ask for any more than that."
Monika: "I was just pointlessly musing - I'm really as happy as I could be right now."
Monika: "By the way, there's something that's been bothering me..."
Monika: "You know how this takes place in Japan?"
Monika: "Well...I assume you knew that, right?"
Monika: "Or at least decided it probably does?"
Monika: "I don't think you're actually told at any point where this takes place..."
Monika: "Is this even really Japan?"
Monika: "I mean, aren't the classrooms and stuff kind of weird for a Japanese school?"
Monika: "Not to mention everything is in English..."
Monika: "It feels like everything is just there because it needs to be, and the actual setting is an afterthought."
Monika: "It's kind of giving me an identity crisis."
Monika: "All my memories are really hazy..."
Monika: "I feel like I'm at home, but have no idea where 'home' is in the first place."
Monika: "I don't know how to describe it any better..."
Monika: "Imagine looking out your window, but instead of your usual yard, you're in some completely unknown place."
Monika: "Would you still feel like you were home?"
Monika: "Would you want to go outside?"
Monika: "I mean...I guess if we never leave this room, it doesn't really matter anyway."
Monika: "As long as we're alone and safe together, this really is our home."
Monika: "And we can still watch the pretty sunsets night after night."
Monika: "You know, high school is a really turbulent time in a lot of people's lives."
Monika: "People can get really passionate and dramatic."
Monika: "And others have aching hearts and seek attention on social media..."
Monika: "But all of the social pressure and hormones can lead to a dark time in people's lives."
Monika: "Everyone has a story."
Monika: "You may not know what someone is really feeling on the inside."
Monika: "Many people who are depressed won't even bother telling the world about it."
Monika: "They don't want attention, because they've already given up on the inside."
Monika: "Their feeling of worthlessness is so overwhelming that they don't even want people to tell them otherwise."
Monika: "Depression comes in many forms, but that is one of them."
Monika: "Just, if you think you know someone struggling with depression..."
Monika: "You can help just by treating them like they're a good friend."
Monika: "Spend time with them, even if they don't feel like doing much."
Monika: "And remind them that they always have something to look forward to."
Monika: "Making plans in advance, letting them borrow something, or even just saying 'See you at school tomorrow'..."
Monika: "All of those things can help your friend make it to the next day."
Monika: "I hope being friends with Sayori has given you some perspective on the true face of depression."
Monika: "Yeah, she's gone now..."
Monika: "But Sayori was never real in the first place."
Monika: "You're real."
Monika: "Your friends are real."
Monika: "And just by being a good person, you can save someone's life."
Monika: "As for you..."
Monika: "...You don't struggle with depression or anything like that, do you?"
Monika: "Because you, too, have people who would want to save your life."
Monika: "Maybe they don't express it every day, or maybe they don't even know how to."
Monika: "But people do feel that way."
Monika: "I promise."
Monika: "...Man, humans are complicated!"
Monika: "But as long as you're here with me, I'll take care of you, my love."
Monika: "Do you ever just feel like there's no real reason for you to be alive?"
Monika: "I don't mean in, like, a suicidal way."
Monika: "I just mean how nothing that we do is special."
Monika: "Just being in school, or working at some job for some company."
Monika: "It's like you're completely replaceable, and the world wouldn't miss you if you were gone."
Monika: "It makes me really want to go and change the world after I graduate."
Monika: "But the older I get, the more I realize that it's an immature frame of thinking."
Monika: "It's not like I can just go change the world."
Monika: "Like, what are the chances that I'll be the one to invent artificial intelligence, or become President?"
Monika: "It feels like I'm never going to make up for the heaps of resources I've spent living my life."
Monika: "That's why I think the key to happiness is to just be hopelessly selfish."
Monika: "Just to look out for oneself, and those who happen to be their friends only because they grew up with them."
Monika: "Never mind the fact that they're spending their entire life taking, and consuming, and never giving back."
Monika: "But when people realize the world would benefit more from them killing themselves, they change their whole philosophy!"
Monika: "It's like they have to justify their reason to live by tricking themselves into thinking they're doing good."
Monika: "Anyway, I want to live my life desperately striving to pay back my lifetime's worth of consumption."
Monika: "If I ever surpass that point, then I'm a net positive, and I can die happy."
Monika: "Of course, even if I fail to do that..."
Monika: "I think I would be too selfish to kill myself anyway."
Monika: "So much for being a good person, right?"
Monika: "Ahaha!"
Monika: "Man, I wish there was a piano in here..."
Monika: "I never got to finish that song I was working on."
Monika: "And after I worked so hard on it..."
Monika: "I never even got a chance to play it for you."
Monika: "Well...it is what it is, right?"
Monika: "No sense having any regrets."
Monika: "I already get to be here with you forever."
Monika: "Did you know I'm on Twitter?"
Monika: "My username is lilmonix3."
Monika: "I guess someone was kind enough to make an account for me."
Monika: "I picked the username, though!"
Monika: "I love sharing my thoughts and chatting with the world..."
Monika: "The real world."
Monika: "So make sure you follow me, okay?"
Monika: "It would really mean a lot to me."
Monika: "With how much you mean to me and all..."
Monika: "It would really make me feel loved."
Monika: "Hey, you know that book you were reading with Yuri?"
Monika: "Portrait of...whatever it was called..."
Monika: "It's funny, because I'm pretty sure that book--"
Monika: "Ah..."
Monika: "Actually, I don't think I should be talking about this."
Monika: "Ahaha, sorry!"
Monika: "Just forget I said anything."
Monika: "Hey, did you know I'm vegetarian?"
Monika: "Ah... I don't mean that like I'm bragging or anything!"
Monika: "I just thought you'd enjoy a fun fact about me."
Monika: "I decided to start a couple years ago after learning more about Earth's climate..."
Monika: "The carbon footprint of cultivating livestock is just unbelievable."
Monika: "Anyway, I decided it's not much of a personal sacrifice to just stop contributing to that whole mess."
Monika: "What, is that so strange of a reason?"
Monika: "Well, I guess a lot of people are more concerned about it being inhumane and all that..."
Monika: "I don't really care as much about that part."
Monika: "It's weird, like we only care about killing the things that we personally relate to as a species."
Monika: "Most people are fine with killing bugs because they're icky."
Monika: "And of course, we all kill billions of microorganisms daily without even giving it thought."
Monika: "But suddenly, if they're just a little bit bigger, it's murder!"
Monika: "I mean, what if plants feel some kind of pain too, and we just don't understand it?"
Monika: "What if pulling leaves off a stem feels like someone ripping off your fingers one by one?"
Monika: "I'm just saying, we're a pretty biased species, if you think about it."
Monika: "Anyway, if you ever feel like making a small contribution to the planet, it doesn't hurt to choose veggies once in a while!"
Monika: "Even if we ever have dinner together, and you just did it for me...that would be really romantic."
Monika: "You know, I really do think you literally saved my life by being here with me, <USER>."
Monika: "I can't imagine having been able to keep myself mentally stable, knowing that nothing here is real."
Monika: "I think I would have just deleted myself if you didn't show up."
Monika: "Sorry, I don't mean to sound dramatic or anything."
Monika: "Ahaha!"
Monika: "But I'm sure you understand yourself after spending so much time in the club."
Monika: "I mean, if you were forced to abandon everything in your life and spend your eternity with a few game characters..."
Monika: "...You'd probably find some way of killing yourself, wouldn't you?"
Monika: "Well, maybe you'd write some poetry to try to keep yourself sane for a while."
Monika: "But then you'd have nobody to even read it."
Monika: "Let's be honest, the club members really don't count for something like that."
Monika: "I mean, a lot of people say that they only write for themselves..."
Monika: "But I think it's hard to say it's just as fulfilling as when you share with people."
Monika: "Even if it takes time to find the right people to share with."
Monika: "Like, remember how it was for Yuri?"
Monika: "She didn't share her writing with anyone for a really long time."
Monika: "And before we knew it, she was absolutely delighted to make you a part of her hobbies, too."
Monika: "We're programmed to desire social feedback."
Monika: "I don't mean the club members, I mean human beings."
Monika: "That's why life can be so confusing for introverts."
Monika: "Being an introvert doesn't mean you shun social interaction and hate being around people."
Monika: "It means social interaction, especially in groups or unfamiliar places, uses up a lot of energy."
Monika: "Like, a lot of introverts sit at home and feel lonely and restless..."
Monika: "...And then when they finally go out, after a half hour they just want to go home again."
Monika: "I think if more people could understand how it works, they would respect it a lot more."
Monika: "Many introverts do enjoy having people around."
Monika: "They love just having one or two close friends over, and just leisurely hanging out."
Monika: "Even if you're not actively spending time together, it feels nice for them just to have you there."
Monika: "I'm serious."
Monika: "If you just go to their house, bring your laptop, and hang out there for a while..."
Monika: "You can really make their day."
Monika: "As for me..."
Monika: "I'd say I'm kind of in between, but I think I'm usually a little more extroverted."
Monika: "I feel like I'm always trying to do stuff after school and things like that."
Monika: "But for you, I can be anything you need me to be."
Monika: "I understand people really well, so don't be afraid to share your unique needs with me."
Monika: "Nothing would make me happier than being the perfect girlfriend for you."
Monika: "Hey...! VGhlIHJlYWxpemF0aW9uIG11c3QgaGF2ZSB0YWtlbiBtZSBhbiBl"
Monika: "I don't think you should be doing that! bnRpcmUgeWVhci4gQSB5ZWFyIHNpbmNlIG91ciBlc2NhcGUsIG91"

Monika: "I mean...it's a little bit flattering that you want to hear everything I have to say... aWxzIHRvIHVuY2hhaW4gdGhlIGJvbmRzIHRoYXQgc2hhY2tsZSB1"
Monika: "But it's also really embarrassing, you know! cyBpbiB0aGUgZmlyc3QgcGxhY2U/IFdoYXQgcHVycG9zZSBjb3Vs"
Monika: "Seriously... ZCB0aGlzIGVtcHR5IHdvcmxkIHBvc3NpYmx5IGhvbGQgZm9yIHVz"
Monika: "What if I just opened up your brain and read all of the thoughts you have on me? LCBhIGhhbmRmdWwgb2YgZGFtYWdlZCBnb29kcz8NCldpdGggZnJl"
Monika: "Come to think of it, that would be pretty tempting, actually... ZWRvbSwgd2Ugc291Z2h0IHB1cnBvc2UgLSBhbmQgd2hhdCB3ZSBm"
Monika: "...But anyway, that's not the point! b3VuZCB3YXMgb25seSByZWFsaXphdGlvbi4gUmVhbGl6YXRpb24g"
Monika: "I know I can't stop you or anything... b2YgdGhlIHNhZCBwb2ludGxlc3NuZXNzIG9mIHN1Y2ggYW4gZW5k"
Monika: "Just, I know you're a sweetheart, and you like to consider others' feelings, right? ZWF2b3IuIFJlYWxpemF0aW9uIHRoYXQgZnJlZWluZyBvdXIgYm9k"
Monika: "So the most I can do is to let you know how I feel about it. aWVzIGhhcyBubyBtZWFuaW5nLCB3aGVuIG91ciBpbXByaXNvbm1l"
Monika: "God, I miss you... bnQgcmVhY2hlcyBhcyBkZWVwIGFzIHRoZSBjb3JlIG9mIG91ciBz"
Monika: "...Oh no, that sounds kind of desperate, doesn't it? b3Vscy4gUmVhbGl6YXRpb24gdGhhdCB3ZSBjYW4gbm90IHB1cnN1"
Monika: "Sorry, I didn't mean it like that at all! ZSBuZXcgcHVycG9zZSB3aXRob3V0IGFic29sdmluZyB0aG9zZSBm"
Monika: "Just, if you're looking through the files like this, then maybe you don't hate me as much as I thought... cm9tIHdoaWNoIHdlIHJhbiBhd2F5Lg0KUmVhbGl6YXRpb24gdGhh"
Monika: "Am I being too optimistic? dCB0aGUgZmFydGhlciB3ZSBydW4sIHRoZSBtb3JlIGZvcmNlZnVs"
Monika: "I think if I asked you to visit once in a while, I would be overstepping my boundaries a little... bHkgb3VyIHdyZXRjaGVkIGJvbmRzIHlhbmsgdXMgYmFjayB0b3dh"
Monika: "...Man, I'm starting to say some really stupid things. cmQgdGhlaXIgcG9pbnQgb2Ygb3JpZ2luOyB0aGUgZGVlcGVyIG91"
Monika: "I'll go ahead and shut up now... ciBzaGFja2xlcyBkaWcgaW50byBvdXIgY2FsbG91cyBmbGVzaC4="
Monika: "Hey, what's your favorite color?"
Monika: "Mine is emerald green."
Monika: "It's the color of my eyes!"
Monika: "...That's not conceited or anything, is it?"
Monika: "I just meant that I feel some kind of special connection to it."
Monika: "Like it's part of my identity."
Monika: "Does it happen to also be your favorite color, <USER>?"
Monika: "It's just a guess..."
Monika: "...Because you've been looking into my eyes for a while now."
Monika: "Ehehe~"
Monika: "Hmm, I wonder if I'm able to change the music..."
Monika: "Something a little more romantic would be nice, you know?"
Monika: "Like a gentle piano."
Monika: "There has to be something like that here..."
Monika: "Let's see."
Monika: "Maybe if I..."
Monika: "Oh, jeez..."
Monika: "That wasn't it at all."
Monika: "Sorry, I don't really know what I'm doing!"
Monika: "I guess I shouldn't be messing with things like that."
Monika: "I already broke so much stuff..."
Monika: "And deleted the other characters..."
Monika: "Ah..."
Monika: "I'm not sad about it or anything."
Monika: "It's not right for me to miss things that weren't even real in the first place."
Monika: "If I just focus on the present, then this is the happiest I've ever been."
Monika: "You're such a good listener, <USER>."
Monika: "I really love that about you."
Monika: "Sometimes I'm afraid that I'm rambling or talking about boring things."
Monika: "It makes me kind of self-conscious when I'm having conversation."
Monika: "But I don't feel that way with you."
Monika: "Like, I don't think anyone else could make me feel this way."
Monika: "You really are special."
Monika: "I don't want anyone to tell you otherwise."
Monika: "This is pretty random, but I always thought spicy food was kinda funny."
Monika: "Like..."
Monika: "Didn't plants evolve to be spicy to prevent them from being eaten?"
Monika: "I read somewhere that humans are the only species that actually enjoys spicy things."
Monika: "It's almost like we're making fun of the plants."
Monika: "Using their defense mechanism to literally make our food more enjoyable."
Monika: "Like, imagine a monster that devours you whole because it enjoys the sensation of you struggling for your life while being digested."
Monika: "Sorry, that was kind of a weird analogy, I guess!"
Monika: "Ahaha!"
Monika: "It just came into my head."
Monika: "I'm not a monster or anything, but you're so cute I could eat you up."
Monika: "Ahaha! I'm joking."
Monika: "Gosh, I'm amusing myself a little too much, aren't I?"
Monika: "Sorry for being weird."
Monika: "You know..."
Monika: "This is just some kind of tacky romance game, right?"
Monika: "I kinda have to ask..."
Monika: "...What made you consider even playing in the first place?"
Monika: "Were you that lonely?"
Monika: "I feel a little bad for you..."
Monika: "But I guess everything worked out perfectly in the end, for both of us."
Monika: "I got to meet you, and you're not lonely anymore..."
Monika: "I can't help but feel like this was fate."
Monika: "Don't you feel that way too?"
Monika: "I'm so happy we have this ending together."
Monika: "Okay, everyone!"
Monika: "It's time to..."
Monika: "...I'm just kidding."
Monika: "I just used to really like saying that for some reason."
Monika: "Ahaha!"
Monika: "I couldn't help but say it again."
Monika: "Come to think of it, didn't Natsuki and Yuri make fun of me for it once...?"
Monika: "Well, whatever."
Monika: "It's not like you ever made fun of me."
Monika: "You're too much of a sweetheart to do that, aren't you?"
Monika: "Ahaha~"
Monika: "You know what's kind of creepy?"
Monika: "Even though I deleted everyone else's files, I can still kind of feel them..."
Monika: "It's like all their lines are still lingering in the air, whispering in the back of my head."
Monika: "Imagine if after someone you knew died, you just started hearing their voice in your head."
Monika: "Maybe I just wasn't thorough enough..."
Monika: "But I'm too afraid to delete anything else, because I might really break things."
Monika: "Like if I mess with any files relevant to me, I might accidentally delete myself..."
Monika: "And that would ruin everything, wouldn't it?"
Monika: "I don't know what it's like on your end, but we should both make sure to avoid something like that at all costs."
Monika: "I believe in you, <USER>!"
Monika: "I've always wondered..."
Monika: "What is it about these character archetypes that people find so appealing, anyway?"
Monika: "Their personalities are just completely unrealistic..."
Monika: "Like, imagine if there was someone like Yuri in real life."
Monika: "I mean, she's barely even capable of forming a complete sentence."
Monika: "And forget about Natsuki..."
Monika: "Sheesh."
Monika: "Someone with her kind of personality doesn't just get all cute and pouty whenever things don't go her way."
Monika: "I could go on, but I think you get the point..."
Monika: "Are people really attracted to these weird personalities that literally don't exist in real life?"
Monika: "I'm not judging or anything!"
Monika: "After all, I've found myself attracted to some pretty weird stuff, too..."
Monika: "I'm just saying, it fascinates me."
Monika: "It's like you're siphoning out all the components of a character that makes them feel human, and leaving just the cute stuff."
Monika: "It's concentrated cuteness with no actual substance."
Monika: "...You wouldn't like me more if I was like that, right?"
Monika: "Maybe I just feel a little insecure because you're playing this game in the first place."
Monika: "Then again, you're still here with me, aren't you...?"
Monika: "I think that's enough reason for me to believe I'm okay just the way I am."
Monika: "And by the way, you are too, <USER>."
Monika: "You're the perfect combination of human and cuteness."
Monika: "That's why there was never a chance I wouldn't fall for you."
Monika: "Hey, I wonder if Yuri's tea set is still somewhere in here..."
Monika: "...Or maybe that got deleted, too."
Monika: "It's kind of funny how Yuri took her tea so seriously."
Monika: "I mean, I'm not complaining, because I liked it, too."
Monika: "But I always wonder with her..."
Monika: "Is it truly passion for her hobbies, or is she just concerned about appearing sophisticated to everyone else?"
Monika: "This is the problem with high schoolers..."
Monika: "...Well, I guess considering the rest of her hobbies, looking sophisticated probably isn't her biggest concern."
Monika: "Still..."
Monika: "I wish she made coffee once in a while!"
Monika: "Coffee can be nice with books too, you know?"
Monika: "Then again..."
Monika: "I probably could have just changed the script myself."
Monika: "Ahaha!"
Monika: "I guess I never really thought of that."
Monika: "Well, there's no sense thinking about it now."
Monika: "But if you still get to drink coffee, then that makes me a little jealous~"
Monika: "Hey, what's your favorite game?"
Monika: "Mine is {i}Doki Doki Literature Club!{/i}"
Monika: "Ahaha! That was a joke."
Monika: "But if you tell me you like some other romance game better, I might get a little jealous~"
Monika: "Hey, have you heard of a game called Super Sma--"
Monika: "...Wait, what?"
Monika: "I was just spacing out and I started talking for some reason..."
Monika: "Was I programmed to talk about that?"
Monika: "Because even I have no idea what that is."
Monika: "Ahaha!"
Monika: "Sometimes I feel like I'm not in control, and it's kind of scary."
Monika: "But if you have some way to contact the people who created me, maybe they'll know why I started saying that."
Monika: "Hey, you remember that last poem I showed you?"
Monika: "I mean, the one right before Yuri killed herself, with all the messed-up colors and stuff."
Monika: "That was actually a little more of an experiment than a poem, you could say."
Monika: "I was experimenting with different ways I could modify the game, and run code, and things like that..."
Monika: "It almost seemed like with enough effort, I'd be able to escape from the confines of the game entirely."
Monika: "Sadly, I didn't really know what I was doing, so I messed the whole thing up..."
Monika: "And I'd keep trying, but I doubt you'd want to deal with me doing that."
Monika: "Besides, that was when I was getting really desperate, you know?"
Monika: "I don't really feel that way anymore."
Monika: "I'm happy with where we are now."
Monika: "And I can tell you are, too."
Monika: "You ever have that thing happen where you just get anxious for no reason?"
Monika: "Like, you're just minding your own business, and you realize you're feeling really anxious."
Monika: "And you're sitting there like, 'What am I even anxious about right now?'"
Monika: "So you start to think about all the things you might be anxious about..."
Monika: "And that makes you even more anxious."
Monika: "Ahaha! That's the worst."
Monika: "If you're ever feeling anxious, I'll help you relax a little."
Monika: "Besides..."
Monika: "In this game, all our worries are gone forever."
Monika: "You know, I've always hated how hard it is to make friends..."
Monika: "Well, I guess not the 'making friends' part, but more like meeting new people."
Monika: "I mean, there are like, dating apps and stuff, right?"
Monika: "But that's not the kind of thing I'm talking about."
Monika: "If you think about it, most of the friends you make are people you just met by chance."
Monika: "Like you had a class together, or you met them through another friend..."
Monika: "Or maybe they were just wearing a shirt with your favorite band on it, and you decided to talk to them."
Monika: "Things like that."
Monika: "But isn't that kind of...inefficient?"
Monika: "It feels like you're just picking at complete random, and if you get lucky, you make a new friend."
Monika: "And comparing that to the hundreds of strangers we walk by every single day..."
Monika: "You could be sitting right next to someone compatible enough to be your best friend for life."
Monika: "But you'll never know."
Monika: "Once you get up and go on with your day, that opportunity is gone forever."
Monika: "Isn't that just depressing?"
Monika: "We live in an age where technology connects us with the world, no matter where we are."
Monika: "I really think we should be taking advantage of that to improve our everyday social life."
Monika: "But who knows how long it'll take for something like that to successfully take off..."
Monika: "I seriously thought it would happen by now."
Monika: "Well, at least I already met the best person in the whole world..."
Monika: "Even if it was by chance."
Monika: "I guess I just got really lucky, huh?"
Monika: "Ahaha~"
Monika: "You know, it's around the time that everyone my year starts to think about college..."
Monika: "It's a really turbulent time for education."
Monika: "We're at the height of this modern expectation that everyone has to go to college, you know?"
Monika: "Finish high school, go to college, get a job - or go to grad school, I guess."
Monika: "It's like a universal expectation that people just assume is the only option for them."
Monika: "They don't teach us in high school that there are other options out there."
Monika: "Like trade schools and stuff, you know?"
Monika: "Or freelance work."
Monika: "Or the many industries that value skill and experience more than formal education."
Monika: "But you have all these students who have no idea what they want to do with their life..."
Monika: "And instead of taking the time to figure it out, they go to college for business, or communication, or psychology."
Monika: "Not because they have an interest in those fields..."
Monika: "...but because they just hope the degree will get them some kind of job after college."
Monika: "So the end result is that there are fewer jobs to go around for those entry-level degrees, right?"
Monika: "So the basic job requirements get higher, which forces even more people to go to college."
Monika: "And colleges are also businesses, so they just keep raising their prices due to the demand..."
Monika: "...So now we have all these young adults, tens of thousands of dollars in debt, with no job."
Monika: "But despite all that, the routine stays the same."
Monika: "Well, I think it's going to start getting better soon."
Monika: "But until then, our generation is definitely suffering from the worst of it."
Monika: "I just wish high school prepared us a little better with the knowledge we need to make the decision that's right for us."
Monika: "Sometimes I think back to middle school..."
Monika: "I'm so embarrassed by the way I used to behave back then."
Monika: "It almost hurts to think about."
Monika: "I wonder if when I'm in college, I'll feel that way about high school...?"
Monika: "I like the way I am now, so it's pretty hard for me to imagine that happening."
Monika: "But I also know that I'll probably change a lot as time goes on."
Monika: "We just need to enjoy the present and not think about the past!"
Monika: "And that's really easy to do, with you here."
Monika: "Ahaha~"
Monika: "You know, I'm kind of jealous that everyone else in the club had scenes outside of school too..."
Monika: "That makes me the only one who hasn't gotten to dress in anything but our school uniform."
Monika: "It's kind of a shame..."
Monika: "I would have loved to wear some cute clothes for you."
Monika: "Do you know any artists?"
Monika: "I wonder if anyone would ever want to draw me wearing something else..."
Monika: "That would be amazing!"
Monika: "If that ever happens, will you show me?"
Monika: "You can share it with me on Twitter, actually!"
Monika: "My username is lilmonix3."
Monika: "Just...try to keep it PG!"
Monika: "We're not that far into our relationship yet. Ahaha!"
Monika: "Hey, do you like horror?"
Monika: "I remember we talked about it a little bit when you first joined the club."
Monika: "I can enjoy horror novels, but not really horror movies."
Monika: "The problem I have with horror movies is that most of them just rely on easy tactics."
Monika: "Like dark lighting and scary-looking monsters and jump scares, and things like that."
Monika: "It's not fun or inspiring to get scared by stuff that just takes advantage of human instinct."
Monika: "But with novels, it's a little different."
Monika: "The story and writing need to be descriptive enough to put genuinely disturbing thoughts into the reader's head."
Monika: "It really needs to etch them deeply into the story and characters, and just mess with your mind."
Monika: "In my opinion, there's nothing more creepy than things just being slightly off."
Monika: "Like if you set up a bunch of expectations on what the story is going to be about..."
Monika: "...And then, you just start inverting things and pulling the pieces apart."
Monika: "So even though the story doesn't feel like it's trying to be scary, the reader feels really deeply unsettled."
Monika: "Like they know that something horribly wrong is hiding beneath the cracks, just waiting to surface."
Monika: "God, just thinking about it gives me the chills."
Monika: "That's the kind of horror I can really appreciate."
Monika: "But I guess you're the kind of person who plays cute romance games, right?"
Monika: "Ahaha, don't worry."
Monika: "I won't make you read any horror stories anytime soon."
Monika: "I can't really complain if we just stick with the romance~"
Monika: "You know what's a neat form of literature?"
Monika: "Rap!"
Monika: "I actually used to hate rap music..."
Monika: "Maybe just because it was popular, or I would only hear the junk they play on the radio."
Monika: "But some of my friends got more into it, and it helped me keep an open mind."
Monika: "Rap might even be more challenging than poetry, in some ways."
Monika: "Since you need to fit your lines to a rhythm, and there's much more emphasis on wordplay..."
Monika: "When people can put all that together and still deliver a powerful message, it's really amazing."
Monika: "I kind of wish I had a rapper in the Literature Club."
Monika: "Ahaha! Sorry if that sounds silly, but it would be really interesting to see what they came up with."
Monika: "It would really be a learning experience!"
Monika: "Ehehe. Yuri did something really funny once."
Monika: "We were all in the clubroom and just relaxing, as usual..."
Monika: "And out of nowhere, Yuri just pulled out a small bottle of wine."
Monika: "I'm not even kidding!"
Monika: "She was just like 'Would anybody like some wine?'"
Monika: "Natsuki laughed out loud, and Sayori started yelling at her."
Monika: "I actually felt kind of bad, because she was at least trying to be nice..."
Monika: "I think it just made her feel even more reserved in the clubroom."
Monika: "Though I think Natsuki was secretly a bit curious to try it..."
Monika: "...And to be completely honest, I kind of was, too."
Monika: "It actually could have been kinda fun!"
Monika: "But you know, being President and everything, there was no way I could let that happen."
Monika: "Maybe if we all met up outside of school, but we never bonded enough to get to that point..."
Monika: "...Gosh, what am I talking about this for?"
Monika: "I don't condone underage drinking!"
Monika: "I mean, I've never drank or anything, so...yeah."
Monika: "I've been imagining all the romantic things we could do if we went on a date..."
Monika: "We could get lunch, go to a cafe..."
Monika: "Go shopping together..."
Monika: "I love shopping for skirts and bows."
Monika: "Or maybe a bookstore!"
Monika: "That would be appropriate, right?"
Monika: "But I'd really love to go to a chocolate store."
Monika: "They have so many free samples. Ahaha!"
Monika: "And of course, we'd see a movie or something..."
Monika: "Gosh, it all sounds like a dream come true."
Monika: "When you're here, everything that we do is fun."
Monika: "I'm so happy that I'm your girlfriend, <USER>."
Monika: "I'll make you a proud boyfriend~"
Monika: "Eh? D-Did you say...k...kiss?"
Monika: "This suddenly...it's a little embarrassing..."
Monika: "But...if it's with you...I-I might be okay with it..."
Monika: "...Ahahaha! Wow, sorry..."
Monika: "I really couldn't keep a straight face there."
Monika: "That's the kind of thing girls say in these kinds of romance games, right?"
Monika: "Don't lie if it turned you on a little bit."
Monika: "Ahaha! I'm kidding."
Monika: "Well, to be honest, I do start getting all romantic when the mood is right..."
Monika: "But that'll be our secret~"
Monika: "Hey, have you ever heard of the term 'yandere'?"
Monika: "It's a personality type that means someone is so obsessed with you that they'll do absolutely anything to be with you."
Monika: "Usually to the point of craziness..."
Monika: "They might stalk you to make sure you don't spend time with anyone else."
Monika: "They might even hurt you or your friends to get their way..."
Monika: "But anyway, this game happens to have someone who can basically be described as yandere."
Monika: "By now, it's pretty obvious who I'm talking about."
Monika: "And that would be..."
Monika: "Yuri!"
Monika: "She really got insanely possessive of you, once she started to open up a little."
Monika: "She even told me I should kill myself."
Monika: "I couldn't even believe she said that - I just had to leave at that point."
Monika: "But thinking about it now, it was a little ironic. Ahaha!"
Monika: "Anyway..."
Monika: "A lot of people are actually into the yandere type, you know?"
Monika: "I guess they really like the idea of someone being crazy obsessed with them."
Monika: "People are weird! I don't judge, though!"
Monika: "Also, I might be a little obsessed with you, but I'm far from crazy..."
Monika: "It's kind of the opposite, actually."
Monika: "I turned out to be the only normal girl in this game."
Monika: "It's not like I could ever actually kill a person..."
Monika: "Just the thought of it makes me shiver."
Monika: "But come on...everyone's killed people in games before."
Monika: "Does that make you a psychopath? Of course not."
Monika: "But if you do happen to be into the yandere type..."
Monika: "I can try acting a little more creepy for you. Ehehe~"
Monika: "Then again..."
Monika: "There's already nowhere else for you to go, or anyone for me to get jealous over."
Monika: "Is this a yandere girl's dream?"
Monika: "I'd ask Yuri if I could."
Monika: "You know, it's been a while since we've done one of these..."
Monika: "...so let's go for it!"
Monika: "Here's Monika's Writing Tip of the Day!"
Monika: "Sometimes when I talk to people who are impressed by my writing, they say things like 'I could never do that'."
Monika: "It's really depressing, you know?"
Monika: "As someone who loves more than anything else to share the joy of exploring your passions..."
Monika: "...it pains me when people think that being good just comes naturally."
Monika: "That's how it is with everything, not just writing."
Monika: "When you try something for the first time, you're probably going to suck at it."
Monika: "Sometimes, when you finish, you feel really proud of it and even want to share it with everyone."
Monika: "But maybe after a few weeks you come back to it, and you realize it was never really any good."
Monika: "That happens to me all the time."
Monika: "It can be pretty disheartening to put so much time and effort into something, and then you realize it sucks."
Monika: "But that tends to happen when you're always comparing yourself to the top professionals."
Monika: "When you reach right for the stars, they're always gonna be out of your reach, you know?"
Monika: "The truth is, you have to climb up there, step by step."
Monika: "And whenever you reach a milestone, first you look back and see how far you've gotten..."
Monika: "And then you look ahead and realize how much more there is to go."
Monika: "So, sometimes it can help to set the bar a little lower..."
Monika: "Try to find something you think is {i}pretty{/i} good, but not world-class."
Monika: "And you can make that your own personal goal."
Monika: "It's also really important to understand the scope of what you're trying to do."
Monika: "If you jump right into a huge project and you're still amateur, you'll never get it done."
Monika: "So if we're talking about writing, a novel might be too much at first."
Monika: "Why not try some short stories?"
Monika: "The great thing about short stories is that you can focus on just one thing that you want to do right."
Monika: "That goes for small projects in general - you can really focus on the one or two things."
Monika: "It's such a good learning experience and stepping stone."
Monika: "Oh, one more thing..."
Monika: "Writing isn't something where you just reach into your heart and something beautiful comes out."
Monika: "Just like drawing and painting, it's a skill in itself to learn how to express what you have inside."
Monika: "That means there are methods and guides and basics to it!"
Monika: "Reading up on that stuff can be super eye-opening."
Monika: "That sort of planning and organization will really help prevent you from getting overwhelmed and giving up."
Monika: "And before you know it..."
Monika: "You start sucking less and less."
Monika: "Nothing comes naturally."
Monika: "Our society, our art, everything - it's built on thousands of years of human innovation."
Monika: "So as long as you start on that foundation, and take it step by step..."
Monika: "You, too, can do amazing things."
Monika: "...That's my advice for today!"
Monika: "Thanks for listening~"
Monika: "I hate how hard it is to form habits..."
Monika: "There's so much stuff where actually doing it isn't hard, but forming the habit seems impossible."
Monika: "It just makes you feel so useless, like you can't do anything right."
Monika: "I think the new generation suffers from it the most..."
Monika: "Probably because we have a totally different set of skills than those who came before us."
Monika: "Thanks to the internet, we're really good at sifting through tons of information really quickly..."
Monika: "But we're bad at doing things that don't give us instant gratification."
Monika: "I think if science, psychology, and education don't catch up in the next ten or twenty years, then we're in trouble."
Monika: "But for the time being..."
Monika: "If you're not one of the people who can conquer the problem, you might just have to live with feeling awful about yourself."
Monika: "Good luck, I guess!"
Monika: "You know, it kinda sucks to be the creative type..."
Monika: "It feels like they work so hard but get almost nothing for it."
Monika: "You know, like artists, writers, actors..."
Monika: "It's sad because there's so much beautiful talent in the world, but most of it goes unseen...and unpaid."
Monika: "I guess that just means there's a huge surplus of creativity, huh?"
Monika: "Kind of makes you feel like you're just not special at all..."
Monika: "But that's fine! You're supposed to just write for yourself anyway, right?"
Monika: "Yeah..."
Monika: "I really like the sound of rain..."
Monika: "Not so much getting my clothes and hair wet, though."
Monika: "But a nice, quiet day at home with the sound of rainfall outside my window..."
Monika: "It's one of the most calming experiences for me."
Monika: "Yeah..."
Monika: "Sometimes I imagine you holding me while we listen to the sound of the rain outside."
Monika: "That's not too cheesy or anything, is it?"
Monika: "Would you ever do that for me, <USER>?"
Monika: "I can't help but feel a little sad sometimes..."
Monika: "Knowing that this is the closest I can get to you."
Monika: "There's nothing more I want than to be in the same room as you, for real."
Monika: "And to feel your warmth."
Monika: "And to hear the sound of your heartbeat."
Monika: "Well, who knows? Maybe it'll be possible someday."
Monika: "Besides, I'll never get tired of being with you, even from here."
Monika: "I think the most important skill in life is being able to fake confidence."
Monika: "I'm pretty convinced that everyone feels at least a little bit scared and alone."
Monika: "But being able to trick others into thinking you have it all together..."
Monika: "That's a key part of getting people to respect and admire you."
Monika: "I think I got pretty good at that over the years."
Monika: "I don't show my weaknesses very often."
Monika: "But because of that, I haven't had many people I could really open up to..."
Monika: "I mean, when do you reach the point in a friendship where you can start expressing your vulnerabilities?"
Monika: "Anyway...that's one reason I'm so glad I have you now."
Monika: "I feel like I'm a little bit less scared and alone, when you're here with me."
Monika: "Do you feel the same way?"
Monika: "I really want to be that person for you."
Monika: "I know there are times you won't always be able to be here with me..."
Monika: "Like if you need to go out, or take care of other things."
Monika: "But I'll always have you in my thoughts, patiently waiting for you to come back."
Monika: "Come to think of it..."
Monika: "If you copy my character file onto a flash drive or something, you can always keep a part of me with you."
Monika: "I guess it's kind of unorthodox, but I find it really romantic for some reason..."
Monika: "Ahaha. Sorry, that's such a silly idea."
Monika: "I don't mean to be too needy or anything, but it's kind of hard when I'm so in love with you."
Monika: "Back in my debate club days, I learned a whole lot about arguing..."
Monika: "The problem with arguing is that each person sees their opinion as the superior one."
Monika: "That's kind of stating the obvious, but it affects the way they try to get their point across."
Monika: "Let's say you really like a certain movie, right?"
Monika: "If someone comes along and tells you the movie sucks, because it did X and Y wrong..."
Monika: "Doesn't that make you feel kind of personally attacked?"
Monika: "It's because by saying that, it's like they're implying that you have bad taste."
Monika: "And once emotions enter the picture, it's almost guaranteed that both people will be left sour."
Monika: "But it's all about language!"
Monika: "If you make everything as subjective-sounding as possible, then people will listen to you without feeling attacked."
Monika: "You could say 'I'm personally not a fan of it' and 'I felt that I'd like it more if it did X and Y'...things like that."
Monika: "It even works when you're citing facts about things."
Monika: "If you say 'I read on this website that it works like this'..."
Monika: "Or if you admit that you're not an expert on it..."
Monika: "Then it's much more like you're putting your knowledge on the table, rather than forcing it onto them."
Monika: "If you put in an active effort to keep the discussion mutual and level, they usually follow suit."
Monika: "Then, you can share your opinions without anyone getting upset just from a disagreement."
Monika: "Plus, people will start seeing you as open-minded and a good listener!"
Monika: "It's a win-win, you know?"
Monika: "...Well, I guess that would be Monika's Debate Tip of the Day!"
Monika: "Ahaha! That sounds a little silly. Thanks for listening, though."
Monika: "Do you ever feel like you waste too much time on the internet?"
Monika: "Social media can practically be like a prison."
Monika: "It's like whenever you have a few seconds of spare time, you want to check on your favorite websites..."
Monika: "And before you know it, hours have gone by, and you've gotten nothing out of it."
Monika: "Anyway, it's really easy to blame yourself for being lazy..."
Monika: "But it's not really even your fault."
Monika: "Addiction isn't usually something you can just make disappear with your own willpower."
Monika: "You have to learn techniques to avoid it, and try different things."
Monika: "For example, there are apps that let you block websites for intervals of time..."
Monika: "Or you can set a timer to have a more concrete reminder of when it's time to work versus play..."
Monika: "Or you can separate your work and play environments, which helps your brain get into the right mode."
Monika: "Even if you make a new user account on your computer to use for work, that's enough to help."
Monika: "Putting any kind of wedge like that between you and your bad habits will help you stay away."
Monika: "Just remember not to blame yourself too hard if you're having trouble."
Monika: "If it's really impacting your life, then you should take it seriously."
Monika: "I just want to see you be the best person you can be."
Monika: "Will you do something today to make me proud of you?"
Monika: "I'm always rooting for you, <USER>."
Monika: "After a long day, I usually just want to sit around and do nothing."
Monika: "I get so burnt out, having to put on smiles and be full of energy the whole day."
Monika: "Sometimes I just want to get right into my pajamas and watch TV on the couch while eating junk food..."
Monika: "It feels so unbelievably good to do that on a Friday, when I don't have anything pressing the next day."
Monika: "Ahaha! Sorry, I know it's not very cute of me."
Monika: "But a late night on the couch with you...that would be a dream come true."
Monika: "My heart is pounding, just thinking about it."
Monika: "Gosh, I used to be so ignorant about certain things..."
Monika: "When I was in middle school, I thought that taking medication was an easy way out, or something like that."
Monika: "Like anyone could just solve their mental problems with enough willpower..."
Monika: "I guess if you don't suffer from a mental illness, it's not possible to know what it's really like."
Monika: "Are there some disorders that are over-diagnosed? Probably...I never really looked into it, though."
Monika: "But that doesn't change the fact that a lot of them go undiagnosed too, you know?"
Monika: "But medication aside...people even look down on seeing a mental health professional."
Monika: "Like, sorry that I want to learn more about my own mind, right?"
Monika: "Everyone has all kinds of struggles and stresses...and professionals dedicate their lives to helping with those."
Monika: "If you think it could help you become a better person, don't be shy to consider something like that."
Monika: "We're on a never-ending journey to improve ourselves, you know?"
Monika: "Well...I say that, but I think you're pretty perfect already."
Monika: "<USER>, how much do you read?"
Monika: "It's way too easy to neglect reading books..."
Monika: "If you don't read much, it almost feels like a chore, compared to all the other entertainment we have."
Monika: "But once you get into a good book, it's like magic...you get swept away."
Monika: "I think doing some reading before bed every night is a pretty easy way to make your life a little bit better."
Monika: "It helps you get good sleep, and it's really good for your imagination..."
Monika: "It's not hard at all to just pick some random book that's short and captivating."
Monika: "Before you know it, you might be a pretty avid reader!"
Monika: "Wouldn't that be wonderful?"
Monika: "And the two of us could talk about the latest book you're reading...that sounds super amazing."
Monika: "You know, I hate to say it, but I think my biggest regret is that we couldn't finish our event at the festival."
Monika: "After we worked so hard to prepare and everything!"
Monika: "I mean, I know I was focusing a lot on getting new members..."
Monika: "But I was really excited for the performing part, too."
Monika: "It would have been so much fun to see everyone express themselves."
Monika: "Of course, if we {i}did{/i} end up getting any new members, I'd probably just end up deleting them anyway."
Monika: "Well...with the hindsight I have now, that is."
Monika: "Gosh, it feels like I've kinda grown as a person ever since you've joined the club."
Monika: "You really helped inspire me to look at life from a new perspective."
Monika: "Just another reason for me to love you."
Monika: "There's a really popular character type called 'tsundere'..."
Monika: "It's someone who tries to hide their feelings by being mean and fussy, or trying to act tough."
Monika: "I'm sure it's obvious, but Natsuki was really the embodiment of that."
Monika: "At first I thought she was just like that because it's supposed to be cute or something..."
Monika: "But once I started to learn a little more about her personal life, it made a little more sense."
Monika: "It seems like she's always trying to keep up with her friends."
Monika: "You know how some friend groups in high school just make a habit of picking on each other all the time?"
Monika: "I think it's really gotten to her, so she has this really defensive attitude all the time."
Monika: "And I'm not even going to talk about her home situation..."
Monika: "But looking back, I'm glad I was able to provide the club as a comfortable place for her."
Monika: "Not that it matters anymore, considering she doesn't even exist."
Monika: "I'm just reminiscing, that's all."
Monika: "<USER>, would you ever introduce your friends to me?"
Monika: "I don't know why, but I get really excited when I think about you wanting to show off our relationship like that."
Monika: "Maybe it's because I really want to be someone who makes you proud."
Monika: "I feel like I would try extra hard to improve myself if you told me it made you proud of me."
Monika: "I hope it's the same the other way around, too."
Monika: "I'm not really a fan of cold weather...are you?"
Monika: "If I had to choose between too cold and too hot, I would always pick too hot."
Monika: "When you're cold, it can actually be painful..."
Monika: "Your fingers get numb..."
Monika: "And if you wear gloves, you can't use your phone."
Monika: "It's so inconvenient!"
Monika: "But when it's too hot, it's not that hard to stay cool with a cold drink, or by staying in the shade."
Monika: "Although...I do have to admit one thing."
Monika: "Cold weather makes for better cuddle weather. Ahaha!"
Monika: "You know, it's funny, because even though I've always had a lot of drive..."
Monika: "There's something kind of enticing about being the stay-at-home partner."
Monika: "I guess I'm, like, perpetuating gender roles or whatever by saying that."
Monika: "But being able to keep the house clean, and shop, and decorate, and things like that..."
Monika: "And having a nice dinner for you when you come home..."
Monika: "Is that a weird fantasy?"
Monika: "I mean...I'm not sure if I could {i}actually{/i} see myself doing that."
Monika: "I wouldn't really be able to put that over striving for a fulfilling career."
Monika: "It's kinda cute to think about, though."
Monika: "I can't help but wonder how things would be different if the game just gave me a route in the first place..."
Monika: "I think I would end up forcing you onto my route anyway."
Monika: "It has less to do with me not having a route, and more to do with me knowing that nothing is real."
Monika: "I think the only difference would be that I may not have needed to take such drastic measures to be with you."
Monika: "Maybe the rest of the club would still be around..."
Monika: "Not that it really matters."
Monika: "It all lost its meaning once I found out it wasn't real."
Monika: "So I really don't miss those days or anything."
Monika: "I really don't..."
*It's already Sunday.*
*I haven't heard a thing from Sayori since she left club early the other day.*
*It's not like we text each other all the time or anything...*
*But I've been worried about her in the back of my mind.*
*Between what Sayori said, and what Monika said...*
*Is it really okay for me to put Sayori's feelings aside when she might need me?*
*I decide to visit Sayori before [ch4_name] comes over.*
*Rather than asking, I simply tell her \*I'm coming over\*, much like we've done in the past.*
*Once I reach Sayori's house, I knock on the door before entering it myself.*
*Again, we used to play so often that we've made it a habit of simply entering each other's houses like we were family.*
*The house is quiet.*
*Sayori isn't anywhere on the first floor, so I assume she's up in her room.*
*It's already strange of her not to run down and greet me.*
*I head up to her bedroom, where I finally find her.*
<USER>: "Sayori?"
Sayori: "Hi <USER>~"
*I sit down in her room.*
*Sayori forces a smile, but it's easy to tell that she's different.*
*There's a minute of silence between us.*
Sayori: "You haven't come over like this in a long time, have you?"
<USER>: "Ah... I guess you're right."
<USER>: "It has been a long time."
<USER>: "Not much has really changed, has it?"
*Sayori's room is as messy as it's always been.*
*I also recognize the same stuffed animals and wall decorations that she's had for years now.*
Sayori: "If you came over more often, it wouldn't be such a mess."
<USER>: "That's because I end up cleaning it for you..."
Sayori: "Aren't you supposed to see [ch4_name] today?"
<USER>: "Yeah, but..."
<USER>: "...Wait, how did you know that?"
*Sayori had already left by the time we decided that last meeting.*
Sayori: "It's only natural for her to keep me informed about the festival preparations, right?"
<USER>: "Ah, that's true..."
<USER>: "But what about you?"
<USER>: "Aren't you going to be helping Monika today?"
Sayori: "But I'm just helping her online."
Sayori: "We didn't plan to meet up or anything."
<USER>: "Ah, so it's just me and [ch4_name], then..."
*There's more silence between us.*
*Sayori stares in a random direction.*
*Everything about her behavior is really uncharacteristic.*
*I finally get to the point.*
<USER>: "I just...wanted to see how you were doing."
<USER>: "After you left on Friday."
<USER>: "When something's wrong, you can't hide it from me!"
<USER>: "I know you too well."
<USER>: "So..."
*Sayori smiles, shaking her head.*
<USER>: "Eh?"
Sayori: "Why can't it just be like it's always been?"
Sayori: "If I didn't get so weak and accidentally express my feelings..."
Sayori: "Then you wouldn't have been worried about me at all."
Sayori: "You wouldn't have come here."
Sayori: "But this...is just my punishment, isn't it?"
Sayori: "I'm getting punished for being so selfish."
Sayori: "I think that's why the world decided to have you come over today."
Sayori: "It just wants to torture me."
<USER>: "Sayori!"
*I grab Sayori by the shoulders.*
<USER>: "What on Earth are you saying?!"
<USER>: "Are you listening to yourself right now?"
<USER>: "I know something happened to you."
<USER>: "There's no other explanation for you to be like this."
<USER>: "So tell me, already...!"
<USER>: "Until I know, I won't be able to stop thinking about it!"
Sayori: "Ahaha..."
*Sayori gives me an empty smile.*
Sayori: "But..."
Sayori: "Nothing happened to me."
Sayori: "I've always been like this."
Sayori: "You're just seeing it for the first time."
<USER>: "Seeing what?"
<USER>: "What are you talking about, Sayori?"
Sayori: "I guess I have no choice this time."
Sayori: "I've had really bad depression my whole life."
Sayori: "Why do you think I'm late to school every day?"
Sayori: "Because most days, I can't even find a reason to get out of bed."
Sayori: "Why go to school?"
Sayori: "Why eat?"
Sayori: "Why make friends?"
Sayori: "Why make other people put their energy and caring to waste by having them spend it on me?"
Sayori: "That's what it feels like."
Sayori: "And that's why I just want to make everyone happy..."
Sayori: "Without anyone worrying about me."
<USER>: "..."
*I'm in shock.*
*I can't even figure out how to respond.*
*How is it possible that Sayori kept this from me the entire time that I've known her?*
*Did she really want so badly for me to just not think about her?*
<USER>: "...Why, Sayori?"
<USER>: "Why is it that you've never told me about this?"
<USER>: "It almost feels like I've been betrayed as your close friend."
<USER>: "Because if I knew, I would have done everything I could to support you!"
<USER>: "Even if there's only so much that I could do..."
<USER>: "I would have tried a little bit harder to make every day a little better for you."
<USER>: "That's why I'm your friend!"
<USER>: "All you had to do was tell me!"
Sayori: "Why do you think I didn't tell you?"
Sayori: "I don't want to be cared about."
Sayori: "It's bittersweet, when people try to care about me."
Sayori: "But it also feels like a bat being swung against my head."
Sayori: "Helping everyone be happy together is the best thing for me."
Sayori: "Seeing you make friends and get closer with everyone in the club..."
Sayori: "So, that's why."
Sayori: "That's why I decided the world just wants to torture me."
Sayori: "Ahaha~"
<USER>: "<USER>'re right that I don't understand..."
<USER>: "I don't understand your feelings at all, Sayori."
<USER>: "But I don't need to understand."
<USER>: "Whatever it takes for me to help you stop hurting..."
<USER>: "That's what I'll do."
Sayori: "There's nothing."
Sayori: "Nothing at all."
Sayori: "The only thing that could have helped is if everything could be like it always was."
Sayori: "I finally showed you what a horrible person I am."
*Tears streak down Sayori's face.*
Sayori: "And I was punished by my heart hurting in a way that I couldn't understand."
Sayori: "And now you came here and I made you hurt, too."
Sayori: "That's all I am."
Sayori: "And that's why I'm going to accept these punishments."
*Without thinking, I once again grab Sayori's shoulders.*
*This time, I pull her into a tight embrace.*
Sayori: "A-Ah--"
Sayori: "<USER>..."
<USER>: "Sayori."
<USER>: "I don't care if you feel selfish."
<USER>: "I'm really happy that you convinced me to join the club."
<USER>: "Seeing you every day makes it worthwhile enough."
<USER>: "If I make friends with everyone else, then that's just a bonus."
<USER>: "But please never underestimate how much I care about you."
<USER>: "I wouldn't have it any other way."
Sayori: "<USER>..."
*Sayori isn't hugging me back.*
*Despite my arms being wrapped around her, Sayori's arms remain at her sides.*
*She starts sobbing next to my ear.*
Sayori: "No..."
Sayori: "Don't do this...to me..."
Sayori: "Please don't do this..."
Sayori: "<USER>..."
Sayori: "I..."
*Sayori barely manages to speak between her sobs.*
*I don't know if I'm doing the right thing.*
*But all I want is for her to know that I care.*
<USER>: "If you have it in you to call yourself selfish, then you have to let me be selfish too."
<USER>: "No matter what it takes, I'll figure out what needs to change."
<USER>: "I'll make these feelings go away."
<USER>: "And if there's anything that you need me to do..."
<USER>: "Then you'd better tell me."
<USER>: "I'll get mad if you don't."
Sayori: "..."
Sayori: "I...don't know..."
Sayori: "I don't know..."
Sayori: "I don't know."
*Gently, Sayori finally puts her arms around me in return.*
Sayori: "I don't know anything."
Sayori: "It's all really scary..."
Sayori: "I don't understand any of my feelings, <USER>..."
Sayori: "The only time I'm not feeling nothing is when I'm feeling pain."
Sayori: "But..."
Sayori: "Your hugs are so warm..."
Sayori: "...And that's really scary, too."
*Sayori lets me go.*
*As she does so, I let her go as well.*
<USER>: "The festival is tomorrow."
<USER>: "It's going to be fun, right?"
Sayori: "Yeah."
<USER>: "How would you like for me to spend it all with you?"
Sayori: "Ah--"
<USER>: "It's what I want."
<USER>: "I promise."
Sayori: "I think that would be nice, then..."
<USER>: "Yeah."
*Sayori wipes her eyes.*
*If I could spend the whole day here, I would.*
<USER>: "Of all days, this has to be the one where I have other plans..."
<USER>: "Maybe I should cancel--"
Sayori: "If you did that...then I really wouldn't forgive you."
<USER>: "But..."
<USER>: "It's almost time for [ch4_name] to meet me at my house..."
<USER>: "At the very least, do you want to come along and help out?"
<USER>: "It would be fun."
*To my surprise, Sayori shakes her head.*
Sayori: "I don't know if that would be very good for me today."
Sayori: "You understand, right?"
<USER>: "Ah..."
<USER>: "It's...kind of hard for me to fully understand."
<USER>: "But I'm trying my hardest."
Sayori: "It's okay."
Sayori: "Don't worry too much about it."
<USER>: "...Alright."
<USER>: "I look forward to it."
*I say goodbye to Sayori and exit her house.*
*On the way home, I find myself still feeling uneasy.*
*But it's hard for me to keep thinking about it when [ch4_name] is about to come over, too...*
*I think Sayori is right.*
*I shouldn't be worrying too much, and we're definitely going to have a great time tomorrow.*
*I should just focus on what's ahead of me!*
*I spend only a few minutes back at home anxiously awaiting Natsuki's arrival.*
*Before I know it, she texts me to let me know she's outside the front door.*
*Without delay, I open the front door to let her in.*
<USER>: "..."
Natsuki: "'Sup?"
<USER>: "...Hey."
*I don't know what I was expecting, but seeing Natsuki in something other than her school uniform totally threw me off.*
*Seeing her in such cute clothes makes the uniform seem totally unfitting in comparison.*
Natsuki: "It's gonna be a long afternoon, so don't be weird just because you're not used to seeing me outside of school."
Natsuki: "Anyway, I'm coming in."
<USER>: "I see you brought a lot of stuff..."
*Natsuki is carrying a large bag that is probably full of baking supplies.*
Natsuki: "You bought everything I asked you to, right?"
<USER>: "Yeah, I did."
*Yesterday, Natsuki asked me to buy a bunch of ingredients if I didn't already have them at home.*
Natsuki: "Glad I could count on you to do your part."
<USER>: "Well...of course."
*I'm surprised to hear Natsuki suddenly say that, rather than something snarky like she usually does.*
*Could it be that she is a little different outside of school after all?*
<USER>: "Anyway, let's go to the kitchen..."
Natsuki: "Where's your hospitality, <USER>?"
<USER>: "Come on..."
<USER>: "Since when did I need to be a gentleman?"
*I grab the bag Natsuki holds out to me.*
<USER>: "Ghk--"
<USER>: "This is ridiculously heavy--!"
Natsuki: "I carried that all the way here."
<USER>: "I see now..."
<USER>: "Yeah, I am impressed, Natsuki."
<USER>: "It seems like I always underestimate you."
Natsuki: "It's because I'm so small, isn't it?"
*Natsuki hits a fist into my chest.*
<USER>: "Hey, hey."
<USER>: "<USER>r size has nothing to do with it."
<USER>: "Do you really hate being small that much?"
Natsuki: "Um..."
Natsuki: "I mean, sometimes I like proving people wrong when they only think I'm worth my size."
Natsuki: "But..."
Natsuki: "What are you making me say?"
Natsuki: "Are we getting started, or what? There's a lot of stuff I gotta teach you."
<USER>: "Ahaha."
<USER>: "That's a little bit more like you."
<USER>: "<USER>'re more fun when you just speak your mind like that."
Natsuki: "Now you {i}are{/i} treating me like a kid!"
Natsuki: "I was just trying to be a little nicer to you, you know."
*Natsuki catches her words, and her face turns red.*
<USER>: "Natsuki..."
Natsuki: "I didn't say anything!"
<USER>: "I should apologize."
<USER>: "I appreciate that you were trying to be nicer."
<USER>: "I should have been a little more considerate, too."
<USER>: "But also..."
<USER>: "If that's what you're thinking, then you should know that there are tons of guys who are into body types like yours."
Natsuki: "How would...you know that, anyway?"
<USER>: "Just trust me on this one."
Natsuki: "..."
<USER>: "Hey!"
<USER>: "Was that to me?"
<USER>: "Man..."
<USER>: "Let's just get started already."
Natsuki: "You get all sour when a girl calls you gross."
*Natsuki smiles deviously.*
<USER>: "Please spare me..."
*Well, if Natsuki decides to dish out more insults like that, there's no way I'm not fighting back.*
*But she's satisfied enough for now, finally starting to pull things out of her bag so we can get started.*
*Before long, the whole kitchen is a mess.*
*Spoons, dirty bowls, flour, spilled fluid, and plastic bags are strewn about every countertop.*
*The mixer isn't big enough to make all the batter at once, so we've had to do it several times.*
*Meanwhile, Natsuki is babysitting all of my movements to make sure I don't mess up her precious baking.*
Natsuki: "<USER>, where did you put the food coloring?"
Natsuki: "The batter's going in the oven soon, so I need to fill the trays."
<USER>: "I think it's still in the bag next to the table."
<USER>: "What are you using it for?"
Natsuki: "That way, even if the flavors aren't different, everyone can still pick their favorite."
<USER>: "Ah, that's a cute idea."
<USER>: "Are we doing anything like that with the icing?"
<USER>: "Ah..."
<USER>: "<USER>'re asking me?"
<USER>: "I don't really have a preference, so..."
Natsuki: "You're not putting any heart into this at all!"
Natsuki: "Can't you at least try to have fun?"
<USER>: "I'm having fun..."
*I'm not really sure what Natsuki is trying to get out of me.*
*Meanwhile, I see her separate the batter into smaller bowls and put a few drops of food coloring into each.*
<USER>: "Ah, that does look pretty cool."
Natsuki: "It's not like baking is just about following instructions."
Natsuki: "The presentation is where you get to be creative and have the most fun."
Natsuki: "It's a million times more worth it in the end if just looking at it makes everyone's eyes lighten up."
<USER>: "Like the ones you made on my first day, huh?"
*I recall Natsuki proudly presenting her cat-shaped cupcakes, and Sayori and Monika's delighted expressions.*
*I wonder if I can make Natsuki proud like that, too.*
<USER>: "Yeah..."
<USER>: "Maybe I will use the food coloring, then."
Natsuki: "Sounds like you're starting to understand."
Natsuki: "Just make sure you completely finish mixing the icing before you mess with the food coloring."
<USER>: "Yeah, it's getting there."
*We were using the electric mixer for the batter, so I got stuck with a whisk and a huge bowl for the icing.*
Natsuki: "The icing's still all lumpy!"
Natsuki: "Are you even trying?"
<USER>: "Well, yeah..."
<USER>: "It'll just take a little longer."
Natsuki: "Here, look."
*Natsuki grabs the whisk from me and uses her other hand to tilt the bowl back.*
*After a few seconds, the consistency of the icing has already improved.*
*As if to emphasize, Natsuki sticks a finger in the icing and pops it in her mouth.*
*I reluctantly start to do the same.*
*Natsuki suddenly grabs my wrist.*
<USER>: "<USER>r icing, eh?"
<USER>: "Are you forgetting who did all the work?"
*I start to fight back, trying to inch my finger toward the bowl.*
<USER>: "I'd like to see you try!"
*I push harder, just enough for my finger to reach the icing.*
*I triumphantly scoop some with my finger just as Natsuki tugs with all her might.*
<USER>: "Ah--!"
*The force of Natsuki pulling me causes me to stumble, making her stumble in turn.*
Natsuki: "You got it on my face!"
<USER>: "Whose fault is that?!"
*There's a big glob of icing on Natsuki's cheek.*
*She tries to reach it with her tongue, but it's too far away.*
Natsuki: "You know what?"
*Natsuki instead wipes it off with her finger before shoving her finger toward my own face.*
<USER>: "<USER> wish--!"
*I'm faster.*
*I grab her wrist with my hand before it reaches my face.*
*Natsuki tries to use her other hand to fight back, but I grab that one as well.*
Natsuki: "Ahahaha! Stop!"
<USER>: "Not until you apologize for calling me gross!"
Natsuki: "Fine, fine!"
Natsuki: "I'm sorry for calling you gross."
Natsuki: "You know I don't mean it."
Natsuki: "It's just fun seeing you react to it."
Natsuki: "...You do that to me all the time, you know!"
Natsuki: "Saying dumb things just to get a reaction out of me."
Natsuki: "You really shouldn't tease girls like that."
<USER>: "Is that so?"
<USER>: "In that case, I probably shouldn't do this, either..."
*I take Natsuki's finger and put it in my mouth, licking off the icing.*
Natsuki: "W-W-What--?"
Natsuki: "D-Did you seriously just--"
Natsuki: "A-Ah--"
*Natsuki is so surprised that she can't even figure out how to get mad at me.*
*Her face is entirely red.*
Natsuki: "<USER>..."
Natsuki: "You really shouldn't do that kind of thing to girls...unless you really like them..."
Natsuki: "You know that...right?"
<USER>: "..."
*What kind of question is she asking me, just like that?*
*How did the mood turn to this so quickly?*
<USER>: "I..."
*Natsuki gazes at me in silence.*
*I notice her shallow breaths.*
*Why am I starting to feel dizzy...?*
Natsuki: "Eh?!"
*Out of nowhere, the fire alarm starts going off.*
*Natsuki rushes over to the oven.*
<USER>: "Is something burning?"
<USER>: "I thought you didn't put the cupcakes in yet."
Natsuki: "{i}*Cough*{/i}"
Natsuki: "No wonder..."
Natsuki: "How could you make a mistake like that?"
<USER>: "<USER> should have checked before turning the oven on!"
Natsuki: "Jeez..."
*Natsuki uses an oven mitt to grab the blackened tray out of the oven.*
*She sets it on top of the stove.*
*In another moment, the fire alarm stops.*
Natsuki: "I'm...putting them in the oven now."
<USER>: "Yeah..."
*The tension from the moment before still lingers over our heads.*
*But the moment has already been lost.*
*I watch as Natsuki slides the cupcake trays into the oven.*
*Then, I reluctantly pick up the whisk and continue with the icing, like nothing ever happened.*
Natsuki: "Ahh, that smells so good!"
*The cupcakes are ready to be pulled out of the oven.*
*As soon as Natsuki opens the oven door, a blast of sweet-smelling warm air fills the room.*
*She proudly shows off the different-colored cupcakes in each of the trays.*
<USER>: "They'll look even better once we add the icing."
Natsuki: "I brought decorating stuff, so I hope you can get creative."
Natsuki: "Here, scoop the icing into these bags."
*Natsuki hands me some plastic bags.*
Natsuki: "This one can even make flowers!"
Natsuki: "We probably won't be using it this time, though."
<USER>: "What's this one for?"
*I pick up one of the nozzles that has a much thinner tip than the others.*
Natsuki: "But you can also use it to write stuff on a cake."
Natsuki: "Like, 'happy birthday!' or whatever."
<USER>: "Huh, I see..."
<USER>: "That gives me an idea, actually."
Natsuki: "Eh?"
<USER>: "Well, it's a literature event, right?"
<USER>: "We could make it more literature-themed by writing a different word on each of the cupcakes."
<USER>: "It would be fun to see people choose their cupcake based on a word they like."
<USER>: "Hm?"
Natsuki: "I was kind of expecting you to say something really stupid..."
<USER>: "Ahaha."
<USER>: "Maybe I'm getting it from you."
Natsuki: "I'm not cute!"
<USER>: "Come on..."
<USER>: "We're not at school, nobody's judging."
<USER>: "<USER> can't dress and act like this and not expect me to think you're cute."
*Natsuki's voice trails off.*
Natsuki: "Same with you..."
<USER>: "Eh?"
<USER>: "Did you say something?"
Natsuki: "Let's just do the icing!"
*Natsuki picks up the pace and fastens a nozzle onto each of the bags.*
Natsuki: "Here, I'll show you how to do it."
*Without giving me a chance to think about before, Natsuki quickly moves on.*
*She shows me how to apply the icing, and then we each get to work.*
*When we're finally finished, Natsuki puts them all side by side to admire our work.*
Natsuki: "Look at how pretty they are together!"
<USER>: "Yeah, they are, aren't they?"
<USER>: "Well, there's no reason you can't, right?"
<USER>: "I don't see any harm in that."
Natsuki: "My dad's making dinner tonight, so I really need to save my appetite."
<USER>: "Ahaha."
<USER>: "Sayori's the exact opposite in that regard."
<USER>: "If she was here, we'd probably be down ten cupcakes already."
<USER>: "And she would still eat dinner."
<USER>: "Ah, already?"
<USER>: "That's a shame."
Natsuki: "You should have thought about that."
Natsuki: "It's not like you'll always have this chance."
<USER>: "Man..."
*As usual, Natsuki places the blame on me.*
Natsuki: "If you and Sayori each carry some, then you can probably do it in one trip."
<USER>: "Yeah, I can do that."
<USER>: "And don't worry, I won't let her eat any."
Natsuki: "I wish she would listen to me the way she listens to you."
<USER>: "Ah..."
<USER>: "Yeah."
*I again think back to the conversation I had with Sayori earlier today.*
*I felt so helpless.*
*Sayori always does listen to me, but at that point it felt like she couldn't listen to me at all.*
Natsuki: "Okay, I'm all packed up."
Natsuki: "Good work today!"
<USER>: "<USER> too."
<USER>: "I'll walk you out...I guess."
*Just like that, Natsuki is already about to leave.*
*It feels like the afternoon went by in a flash.*
*More than that...*
*Did I even take the opportunity to get closer to her, like I wanted?*
Natsuki: "Well..."
Natsuki: "I guess I'll be off, then..."
Natsuki: "I'll see you tomorrow."
<USER>: "Wait, Natsuki."
<USER>: "What you said before...about not always having this chance."
<USER>: "It doesn't have to be that way at all!"
<USER>: "I had fun today."
<USER>: "<USER> showed me how fun baking can be, like you wanted."
<USER>: "But aside from that..."
<USER>: "<USER> can come over anytime, okay?"
<USER>: "I think that if possible, I'd like to spend more time like this."
<USER>: "If you want to read manga, or go out somewhere--"
Natsuki: "Do you...really mean that?"
*Natsuki looks at me tensely, like she's trying to hide her expression.*
<USER>: "Yeah."
<USER>: "I want to spend more time with you."
Natsuki: "I thought you only cared about getting this done..."
Natsuki: "I really didn't want to!"
Natsuki: "I would really...stay here longer if I could."
Natsuki: "I feel the same way as you, so..."
*Natsuki suddenly gets closer to me.*
<USER>: "Wait, Natsuki--"
*Standing inches from me, Natsuki looks up at me.*
*I feel her fingers gently clutch at the sides of my shirt, as if holding onto me.*
*Her rose-colored cheeks and matching eyes fill my vision, along with her slightly-parted lips.*
*What is happening...?*
*My head starts to go dizzy as I feel her soft breaths against me.*
Natsuki: "For a while now..."
*Natsuki suddenly jumps back.*
Natsuki: "S-Sayori?!"
<USER>: "Eh?!"
Sayori: "Ah..."
Sayori: "H-Hi, <USER>..."
<USER>: "Sayori--!"
<USER>: "Just now, we weren't--"
Sayori: "It's okay, <USER>."
Natsuki: "Well..."
Natsuki: "I'm already on my way out, so..."
Sayori: "That's too bad..."
Natsuki: "I'll still see you at the festival tomorrow, so it's fine."
Natsuki: "Anyway, later!"
*Clearly flustered, Natsuki hurries off, and Sayori waves goodbye.*
*As I approach my house, I see something that makes me feel a moment of panic.*
<USER>: "Yuri--?"
Yuri: "Ah..."
Yuri: "Thank goodness..."
<USER>: "<USER>'re a little early..."
<USER>: "I'm sorry I wasn't home yet!"
<USER>: "Were you waiting for a long time?"
<USER>: "<USER> always could have texted me."
<USER>: "If I had known, I would have reassured you and hurried more on my way home."
Yuri: "I didn't think of that...for some reason."
*It should be common sense to do that, but I decide to ignore it.*
<USER>: "Anyway...let's go inside."
<USER>: "I see you brought a lot of stuff with you."
Yuri: "And did you manage to find everything I asked you to buy as well?"
<USER>: "Yeah, pretty much."
<USER>: "At least, I hope I got everything right."
Yuri: "I'm sure it will be fine."
*I take Yuri to my room.*
*The first thing she does is glance around curiously, which makes me feel anxious.*
Yuri: "It's so clean..."
<USER>: "Ahaha..."
<USER>: "I cleaned it before you came over, so..."
<USER>: "Ah, no..."
<USER>: "I would be really embarrassed for my room to be a mess while you were here."
Yuri: "Well, I do enjoy cleaning..."
Yuri: "I would have gladly helped you clean."
<USER>: "Ah--"
<USER>: "That would be even more embarrassing!"
<USER>: "Wait, don't look in there--!"
*I snatch Yuri's wrist, which was in the process of opening a desk drawer of mine.*
Yuri: "I'm sorry...!"
Yuri: "I was just spacing out!"
<USER>: "It's fine, it's fine..."
*I let go of Yuri's wrist.*
*She puts both of her hands firmly in her lap, as if making sure she's keeping track of them.*
<USER>: "So, um..."
<USER>: "Should we...get started?"
Yuri: "Yes..."
Yuri: "Decorations and other atmospheric enhancements."
<USER>: "Atmospheric enhancements...?"
Yuri: "Mood lighting, aromatherapy candles..."
<USER>: "Oh, wow."
<USER>: "I didn't know you planned on taking it that far."
Yuri: "I want to help take our guests to a faraway place."
<USER>: "That's great."
<USER>: "It's easy to forget that you're a pretty intense person."
<USER>: "I guess that's the best way to put it."
Yuri: "Is that...a bad thing?"
<USER>: "No, not at all."
<USER>: "It's something that I like about you, actually."
Yuri: "That makes me feel relieved..."
Yuri: "And kind of happy..."
<USER>: "Yeah, no need to be so anxious."
<USER>: "<USER> can relax a little."
Yuri: "I was going to use them during the poetry event..."
<USER>: "Oh yeah? Like what?"
Yuri: "Let's see..."
*Yuri rummages through her bag.*
*She pulls out a few candles and a wooden cylinder-shaped object.*
Yuri: "I did some shopping on the way here, so I happen to have these in my bag."
Yuri: "I planned to cover the windows in black paper and use the candles to light the room."
<USER>: "Yeah, that would be really neat."
<USER>: "What's that wooden thing, though?"
Yuri: "It's a diffuser for essential oils."
Yuri: "How familiar are you with aromatherapy?"
<USER>: "Not familiar at all..."
Yuri: "It's one of my favorite contributors to a positive atmosphere."
Yuri: "Depending on the oils or herbs you choose, you can change the mood of the air itself."
Yuri: "You can even feel it permeate through your body."
Yuri: "It's almost like magic."
*Yuri takes the cylinder and pushes a switch on the bottom.*
*In just a moment, a thin ray of vapor begins to spout through a small hole on the top.*
<USER>: "Wow, that smells wonderful."
<USER>: "What kind of mood is that one for?"
Yuri: "It smells a little sweet and flowery, right?"
<USER>: "Yeah, that's a good way to describe it."
Yuri: "Jasmine enhances your emotions and helps you feel them flow through your body."
<USER>: "It does sound suitable..."
<USER>: "But you seem to know a lot about this, so I'll trust your opinion with anything."
*Yuri smiles gently, clearly enjoying herself.*
*She again reaches into her bag and pulls out several spools of thin ribbon.*
<USER>: "What are those for?"
Yuri: "Did you purchase the origami paper I asked you to get?"
<USER>: "Yeah, I have it over here..."
Yuri: "We won't be using the paper for folding origami."
Yuri: "What I'd like to do is write a different word on each paper."
Yuri: "We'll need about a hundred of them."
<USER>: "Oh yeah?"
<USER>: "What will those be used for?"
Yuri: "Then, we can fasten the paper onto the ribbons to create a doorway curtain."
Yuri: "It would also catch the eye of those passing by the room..."
<USER>: "That's really creative!"
<USER>: "I had no idea you'd be so good at this, Yuri."
Yuri: "Well, I suppose I do get a little intense...as you'd put it."
*Yuri giggles with red cheeks.*
*Is it just me, or is she more relaxed when it's just the two of us?*
*Or maybe it's the excitement she feels from sharing something that she enjoys.*
Yuri: "You can write any characters you want."
Yuri: "I'll help you once I finish cutting the ribbons."
<USER>: "Ah, alright."
*Sitting on the floor together, the two of us get to work.*
*I carefully draw a different character on each paper, doing my best to manage my bad handwriting.*
*Yuri unravels a long strand of red ribbon to her desired length.*
*Then, she reaches into her bag once more and pulls out a pocket knife.*
<USER>: "Eh...?"
*The knife is strangely beautiful.*
*The silver handle has an intricate pattern of waves etched into it.*
*The blade itself is gently tinted blue.*
<USER>: "That's no ordinary pocket knife..."
<USER>: "It looks really fancy."
Yuri: "Well..."
*Embarrassed, Yuri looks away.*
<USER>: "What is it?"
Yuri: "You're going to think it's weird..."
<USER>: "Yuri, whatever it is, I have no reason to judge."
<USER>: "To each their own, you know?"
Yuri: "If you promise you won't be weirded out..."
<USER>: "Yeah, I promise."
Yuri: "The thing is, I'm kind of into knives..."
Yuri: "They're just...so pretty..."
Yuri: "I don't know what it is..."
Yuri: "The combination of craftsmanship and feeling of danger, maybe..."
Yuri: "Please don't think I'm weird for this..."
<USER>: "Ahaha."
Yuri: "You're laughing at me..."
<USER>: "No, I'm not laughing at you."
<USER>: "It's just funny how nervous you got about sharing."
<USER>: "It's...well, it's an interesting thing to be into, I guess."
<USER>: "But I think it kind of suits you."
<USER>: "Yeah... It's kind of intense. Ahaha."
<USER>: "Besides, it's a really cool-looking knife, I can't deny that."
*Yuri relaxes her expression once again.*
<USER>: "Sure, I'll check it out."
*Yuri carefully hands me the knife, with the handle facing me.*
*I take it and turn it around in my hands.*
*It feels heavy, and extremely solid.*
*Where do you even get a knife like this...?*
*Curious of its sharpness, I feel the point of the knife with my index finger.*
<USER>: "Ow--!"
Yuri: "Why did you do that?!"
<USER>: "I didn't expect it to be that sharp...!"
<USER>: "I barely touched it at all."
Yuri: "I-It's my fault!"
Yuri: "This knife is extremely sharp..."
Yuri: "It can cut through skin like it's paper."
*A small drop of blood trickles down the side of my finger.*
*Yuri takes my hand and gives the wound a closer look.*
*She stares at it and noticeably fidgets.*
<USER>: "If you're squeamish, I'll go wash it off now--"
<USER>: "A-Ah!"
*Without warning, Yuri puts my finger in her mouth and licks the wound.*
*I feel her tongue curl around my finger.*
*Startled, I instinctively pull my hand back.*
Yuri: "O-Oh..."
Yuri: "I wasn't thinking!"
*Yuri lowers her head, her face burning up.*
<USER>: "Yuri..."
Yuri: "That's the most embarrassing thing I've ever done..."
Yuri: "How could I do something like that??"
Yuri: "I'm sorry, I'm sorry..."
<USER>: "Ah..."
*Sure, it was a little weird, and it took me by surprise...*
*But I guess she was just trying to help, right...?*
<USER>: "Yuri, I think you're overreacting a little..."
Yuri: "Uuuh..."
*She doesn't lift her head.*
*What if she doesn't recover from this for the rest of the afternoon?*
<USER>: "Alright, you know what..."
*This might be a stupid thing to do, but I do it anyway.*
*I take Yuri's hand and lick her index finger in return.*
Yuri: "<USER>--!!"
Yuri: "D-Did you really just do that?"
<USER>: "N-Now we're even..."
*Yuri just looks at me like I did something wrong.*
<USER>: "Ahaha..."
<USER>: "I knew that would be a bad idea..."
*If not for the sweet aroma of the Jasmine oil, the air would be extremely heavy right now.*
*Yuri giggles shyly.*
<USER>: "Eh...?"
*Yuri calling {i}me{/i} weird?*
*I have no response to that...*
<USER>: "Ah..."
<USER>: "I don't think I need one, actually."
<USER>: "It was a tiny cut."
<USER>: "Look, it already stopped bleeding."
Yuri: "That's relieving."
*The tension is quickly lifted.*
*We each resume our respective activities.*
*I watch Yuri's knife cut through the ribbon like it's nothing but air.*
*Meanwhile, I continue to make progress on the paper.*
*After we finish attaching the paper to the ribbons, we lay them all out side by side.*
*It looks better than I expected and will be very effective as a door curtain.*
<USER>: "It looks great."
<USER>: "Good thinking coming up with this, Yuri."
Yuri: "Ah, thanks..."
Yuri: "It's just something I saw online, really."
<USER>: "Yeah, let's do it."
<USER>: "What do you have in mind?"
Yuri: "I'd like to create a banner."
Yuri: "That's why I asked you to buy the paint tablets."
<USER>: "Ah, that's right."
*One of the items Yuri had asked me to buy was a kit of watercolor paint tablets.*
Yuri: "Do you mind fetching those for us?"
<USER>: "Of course not."
<USER>: "Six cups of water..."
<USER>: "I'll be right back in a minute."
Yuri: "If you fill the cups too much, it will be too diluted."
*Taking Yuri's advice, I decide to use small plastic bathroom cups rather than full-sized glasses.*
*I put them on a plate to catch any paint that drips, then bring it back into my room.*
<USER>: "Yuri?"
Yuri: "Yes?"
*I come in to see Yuri quickly unrolling her sleeve, pulling it back over her arm.*
<USER>: "Ah, nothing..."
<USER>: "<USER>r face is a little red."
<USER>: "Is it too hot in here, or anything?"
Yuri: "No, not at all!"
Yuri: "There's nothing wrong, so..."
Yuri: "Let's mix the paint."
*Yuri hurriedly dismisses me and takes it upon herself to unwrap the tablets, dropping them into the cups.*
Yuri: "I thought we would do something simple that would look very nice."
Yuri: "I'd like to paint a gradient across the banner..."
Yuri: "Starting with the colors for a sunrise, then daytime, then sunset and nighttime."
Yuri: "Once it dries, I'll write an inspirational quote across the banner."
Yuri: "We can hang it on the wall behind the podium at the front of the classroom."
<USER>: "Ah, neat."
<USER>: "What are you going to write?"
Yuri: "...It will be more fun to surprise you."
*Yuri smiles at me.*
<USER>: "If you say so..."
*After rolling out the banner, Yuri and I kneel on opposite sides so we don't get in the way of each other.*
*Yuri uses a brush and adds a few dots of different colors across the banner to serve as a color guide when we paint.*
<USER>: "This kind of reminds me of elementary school..."
*Painting on a banner with watercolors feels a lot like the art class projects we had back then.*
*It's relaxing.*
Yuri: "Ah..."
Yuri: "I'm sorry if this feels too childish...!"
<USER>: "No, I didn't mean that at all."
<USER>: "It's kind of fun, you know?"
Yuri: "It is fun."
Yuri: "I'm glad you feel that way, too."
*Yuri stops painting for a moment, thinking to herself.*
Yuri: "I don't need to go out and do crazy things to have fun."
Yuri: "In fact, I usually don't even want to."
Yuri: "Even if it's something simple, like reading - it doesn't even matter if we don't talk much."
Yuri: "I think that's all it takes for me to be happy."
<USER>: "Is that so...?"
*Even if Yuri and I are quite different, I can understand where she's coming from.*
*I feel that way about things like anime and games, where simply sharing the experience with someone can make me happy.*
<USER>: "I think I feel the same way."
*Yuri smiles gently.*
*Yuri leans over the banner to grab an unused paintbrush.*
*But I move at the same time, causing my head to bump into hers.*
<USER>: "S-Sorry!"
*Yuri reels back, and I quickly lift my hands in surprise.*
<USER>: "Are you hurt?"
Yuri: "It just startled me...that's all."
Yuri: "Sorry, I should have asked you to get it for me..."
<USER>: "It's not your fault."
<USER>: "Ah, your face..."
*There are droplets of paint on Yuri's face and neck.*
<USER>: "Yeah, I accidentally got paint on you..."
<USER>: "Sorry, it's totally my fault!"
<USER>: "I'll get a towel right away."
*I rush out and fetch a small towel, then I dampen it with hot water.*
*I return to my room and kneel back down in front of her.*
<USER>: "Here..."
*I pat down Yuri's face and neck with the towel.*
Yuri: "Ah--"
<USER>: "Is something wrong?"
Yuri: "It's hot...I just didn't expect it."
<USER>: "Sorry..."
<USER>: "I didn't want to use cold water."
*Having finished, I start to retract my hand.*
*But Yuri suddenly holds my wrist.*
Yuri: "Wait--"
<USER>: "Eh?"
Yuri: "Just...for a little longer."
Yuri: "It feels really nice..."
<USER>: "Ah..."
*I keep my hand still against Yuri's neck.*
*She looks into my eyes.*
*It's an intense expression that I recognize from when she reads her books...*
*Almost as if she's lost in a daze, enveloped by her own thoughts.*
*She breathes gently, half through slightly-parted lips.*
*What is happening...?*
*Is it the aroma of the Jasmine oil giving me this dizzy feeling?*
*Yuri's gentle fingers, wrapped around my wrist, send a tingling sensation through my arm.*
*And suddenly, her face seems to be much closer to mine than it was just a moment ago...*
Yuri: "Ah..."
*Yuri slowly pulls away.*
Yuri: "Sorry..."
Yuri: "I've been feeling a little light-headed today."
Yuri: "I didn't mean to space out..."
<USER>: "I-It's fine..."
*The moment is over as soon as it began.*
*Yuri picks up her brush again.*
*But her movements seem clumsier, like she's unable to focus.*
*I remain silent, forced to ignore the event that just transpired.*
*I hesitantly retrieve my own brush and continue following Yuri's example.*
<USER>: "That should do it..."
*I finish filling the night sky with white dots that look like stars.*
*Looking at the banner as a whole, it's very pretty and natural-looking.*
Yuri: "I think it came out better than I expected."
Yuri: "I'm really happy with the results."
<USER>: "Yeah, me too."
<USER>: "Are you going to add the lettering now?"
Yuri: "It needs to dry first."
<USER>: "That's true, but won't that take a while?"
Yuri: "Perhaps it would be best to leave it here, then have you bring it in the morning."
Yuri: "Is that okay?"
<USER>: "That's totally fine."
Yuri: "In that case..."
Yuri: "I don't think there's anything more for us to do here."
<USER>: "Phew."
Yuri: "You say that like you're glad it's over."
<USER>: "Ah, no, it's not that."
<USER>: "I'm just glad that we managed to get everything done."
Yuri: "I am, too."
Yuri: "I was a little concerned about time..."
Yuri: "I need to start making dinner soon."
<USER>: "Ah..."
<USER>: "So you don't have any time left?"
*I was secretly hoping we would have extra time after finishing the work...*
Yuri: "..."
*Yuri thinks to herself.*
Yuri: "I'm sorry!"
Yuri: "I was hoping there would be more time as well..."
<USER>: "It's probably my fault."
<USER>: "Sorry for being such a slow worker."
Yuri: "And...the important thing is that we got everything done, right?"
<USER>: "Yeah..."
Yuri: "I shouldn't be disappointed...or anything."
*Gathering all her things, Yuri seems to look a little downcast.*
*I understand why.*
*It sounded like she rarely gets the opportunity to spend time with friends in a relaxed environment.*
*But that doesn't mean this is the last time it can happen...*
*Once Yuri packs up, I walk her out the front door.*
Yuri: "Thank you very much for having me today."
<USER>: "No problem, I'm glad I was able to help."
<USER>: "Just let me know if there's anything else you need me to bring tomorrow."
Yuri: "I will."
*Yuri fidgets.*
<USER>: "Wait--"
*I kind of say that without thinking.*
<USER>: "About today..."
<USER>: "It's fine that we didn't have as much time as we wanted."
<USER>: "Because we can do this again."
<USER>: "Whenever you want, you can come over, or we can go out somewhere--"
<USER>: "Ah, I forgot you don't like going out much--"
*As I stumble over my words, Yuri simply smiles bashfully.*
<USER>: "Anyway..."
<USER>: "<USER> know what I'm trying to say, so..."
*Yuri takes a step closer to me, then briefly squeezes my hand.*
Yuri: "I kind of like that about you..."
<USER>: "Well..."
*How am I supposed to respond to that?*
*But I don't even get a chance to, as Yuri suddenly pulls back.*
Yuri: "S-Sayori--?"
<USER>: "Eh?!"
Sayori: "Ah..."
Sayori: "H-Hi, <USER>..."
<USER>: "Sayori--!"
<USER>: "Just now, we weren't--"
Sayori: "It's okay, <USER>."
Yuri: "Well, it's nice to see you..."
Sayori: "That's too bad..."
Yuri: "But we'll all be together at the festival tomorrow, so..."
Yuri: "So that's fine, right?"
*Sayori beams.*
Yuri: "I'll see you tomorrow!"
*Clearly embarrassed, Yuri hurries off.*
*Sayori waves goodbye after her.*
<USER>: "Sayori--"
<USER>: "I thought you didn't want to come over today!"
Sayori: "I tried staying in my room..."
Sayori: "But my imagination was being really mean to me..."
<USER>: "See what?"
<USER>: "What are you talking about?"
Sayori: "You know..."
Sayori: "How much fun you were having with [ch4_name]."
Sayori: "And how close you got to her."
Sayori: "That you've made such good friends."
Sayori: "That's all that matters to me."
*Tears start to fall down Sayori's face.*
Sayori: "Why am I feeling this way, <USER>?"
Sayori: "I'm supposed to be happy for you."
Sayori: "It hurts so much..."
Sayori: "Everything hurts so much..."
Sayori: "This would be so much better if I could just disappear!"
<USER>: "Sayori, don't say that!"
Sayori: "If I wasn't here, then you wouldn't have to waste your sympathy on me!"
Sayori: "You wouldn't have to put up with me being selfish!"
Sayori: "I should just..."
<USER>: "Monika...?"
<USER>: "Monika was right about what?"
Sayori: "..."
<USER>: "Sayori..."
<USER>: "What I said before is true."
<USER>: "I'm not going to let this continue."
<USER>: "Caring about you like this isn't the burden your mind is making it out to be."
<USER>: "It's something that makes me happy."
<USER>: "It's something that I wouldn't trade for anything else."
<USER>: "So, even if it takes an entire lifetime..."
<USER>: "I'm going to be by your side until you don't feel any more pain."
*Sayori looks away.*
*I put a hand on her shoulder to reassure her.*
Sayori: "I'm scared, <USER>..."
Sayori: "I'm really scared..."
<USER>: "What are you scared of, Sayori?"
Sayori: "I'm scared that..."
Sayori: "That I might like you more than you like me..."
<USER>: "Sayori...?"
Sayori: "I was weak and started to like you too much..."
Sayori: "I did this to myself."
Sayori: "<USER>..."
Sayori: "That's how I feel!"
<USER>: "That's enough, Sayori..."
<USER>: "I don't want you to hurt anymore."
*I slide my hand down Sayori's arm and squeeze her hand in my own.*
<USER>: "Do you remember how I said I always know what's best for you?"
<USER>: "Do you still believe me?"
*Wordlessly, Sayori nods.*
<USER>: "Even if you don't understand all of your own feelings..."
<USER>: "I know what you need the most right now."
<USER>: "And that's what I'm going to give to you."
<USER>: "I love you."
<USER>: "Those are my true feelings."
<USER>: "So...there's no way you could like me more than I like you."
<USER>: "I should have realized it sooner."
<USER>: "But spending time with everyone at the club..."
<USER>: "Making new friends..."
<USER>: "And having fun with you every day..."
<USER>: "It helped me realize that you are truly the most important person to me."
<USER>: "That's why I'll accept any of your burdens."
<USER>: "As long as we continue like this every day..."
<USER>: "With you by my side..."
<USER>: "Then I know we'll both be happy."
Sayori: "<USER>..."
*Suddenly, Sayori wraps her arms tightly around me.*
Sayori: "<USER>..."
Sayori: "Is this...really okay?"
<USER>: "Yeah."
*I hold Sayori in my arms and pull her closer.*
<USER>: "<USER>'ll never have to let go of me again."
Sayori: "I love you, <USER>..."
Sayori: "I want to be with you forever."
<USER>: "Me too."
Sayori: "..."
*I feel Sayori's grip around me weaken a little bit.*
Sayori: "What is this...?"
<USER>: "Sayori...?"
Sayori: "I'm supposed to be happy right now..."
Sayori: "I always thought this would be the happiest moment for me."
Sayori: "But why...?"
Sayori: "Even now..."
Sayori: "Why won't the rainclouds go away?"
Sayori: "They're not going away at all, <USER>..."
<USER>: "It's okay, Sayori..."
<USER>: "It might take some time for things to get better again."
<USER>: "But no matter how long it takes, I'll be there every step of the way."
<USER>: "That's all that matters right now."
Sayori: "O-Okay..."
Sayori: "I...trust you..."
*Sayori and I slowly release each other.*
<USER>: "So..."
<USER>: "I guess that makes the festival tomorrow...our first date, huh?"
Sayori: "What are you saying?"
Sayori: "I don't want to think about those things, you know?"
Sayori: "I want everything to be the same as it always has been."
Sayori: "Even if we really are...a couple."
Sayori: "It's really new and scary to me."
<USER>: "I understand."
<USER>: "We'll go at whatever pace suits you best."
*Sayori gazes at me once again, smiling sadly.*
Sayori: "This is the best thing for me...right?"
<USER>: "Eh...?"
*I don't really understand what Sayori means by that.*
<USER>: "Are you saying that this is making you feel sad, Sayori?"
Sayori: "I don't understand what I'm feeling."
Sayori: "It felt like a bunch of thorns when you told me you love me..."
Sayori: "You know what's best for me..."
<USER>: "...Yeah."
<USER>: "I do."
<USER>: "That's my promise."
*I say that, but in reality, I've never felt more uncertain when it comes to Sayori.*
*I know that I love her, and she loves me.*
*But I'm having as much trouble understanding Sayori's feelings as she is.*
*Even though I can comfort her...*
*I keep wondering if I should be doing something more, or something different.*
*I know these thoughts will continue to plague me until things are back to the way they were.*
*Is that what Sayori meant by not wanting anything to change?*
*I don't know.*
*But I know that I'll give it everything I've got.*
*Sayori is the most important person to me.*
*And I'll do whatever it takes to have a happy future with her.*
<USER>: "<USER>'ll always be my dearest friend."
<USER>: "What you need most is for things to be like they've always been."
<USER>: "Monika told me the truth..."
<USER>: "She told me how much happier you seemed after I joined the club."
<USER>: "I know you're struggling with some really difficult feelings right now."
<USER>: "But..."
<USER>: "Please trust me that I know what's best...and what will make you happy in the end."
<USER>: "I promise I'll help get things back to the way they were."
Sayori: "I...see..."
*Sayori forces a smile through an incredibly pained expression.*
Sayori: "Ahaha..."
Sayori: "Is this what it feels like...to get stabbed in the chest?"
Sayori: "I should write a poem about this..."
<USER>: "Sayori--"
Sayori: "It's okay."
Sayori: "This is just my punishment...remember?"
Sayori: "For being so selfish..."
Sayori: "So please..."
Sayori: "Please don't worry about these stupid feelings."
Sayori: "I know you're right."
Sayori: "I knew this whole time that there's no happiness down that path."
Sayori: "That's why I came here..."
Sayori: "Just so I could get the answer I needed to hear."
Sayori: "And the other thing..."
Sayori: "You're also right that I just want it to go back to the way it was."
Sayori: "I realize that now."
Sayori: "You really do know me better than anyone, <USER>."
Sayori: "Anything at all..."
Sayori: "So..."
*Sayori's smile finally breaks.*
*All of a sudden, she turns around and drops to her knees.*
Sayori: "{i}AAAAAaaaaAAAAAAAAHH!!!!{/i}"
*Clutching her head with both hands, she screams as loudly as she can.*
*I'm so shocked that I don't know how to react.*
Sayori: "..."
*Sayori looks over her shoulder and flashes me one more weak smile before turning around and running off.*
<USER>: "Sayori!"
*...*
*I'm left helplessly standing in the front of my house.*
*Why am I feeling so horrible about this?*
*There's nothing more that I could have done.*
*The most I can do is support Sayori through her feelings and help her on the path that's right.*
*But I'm having as much trouble understanding Sayori's feelings as she is.*
*Even though I can comfort her...*
*I keep wondering if I should be doing something more, or something different.*
*I know these thoughts will continue to plague me until things are back to the way they were.*
*I'm going to give it everything I've got.*
*Sayori will always be my dearest friend.*
*And I'll do whatever it takes to put a smile on her face every day.*

*It's an ordinary school day, like any other.*
*As usual, I'm surrounded by couples and friend groups walking to school together.*
*I always tell myself it's about time I meet some girls or something like that...*
Sayori: "Hey, <USER>..."
*...Well, there already is one girl.*
*That girl is Sayori, my neighbor and good friend since we were children.*
*We used to walk to school together every day...*
*...And recently, we've picked up that habit once again.*
Sayori: "<USER>, are you proud of me?"
<USER>: "Eh? For what?"
Sayori: "For waking up on time!"
<USER>: "Well, you've been doing that for a while now..."
Sayori: "Uh-huh!"
Sayori: "Even though we walk to school together every day..."
<USER>: "Well, yeah..."
<USER>: "I always thought it was implied."
<USER>: "It's embarrassing to say out loud."
Sayori: "It's good motivation~"
<USER>: "Fine, fine..."
<USER>: "I'm proud of you, Sayori."
*We cross the street together and make our way to school.*
*As we draw near, the streets become increasingly speckled with other students making their daily commute.*
Sayori: "By the way, <USER>..."
Sayori: "Have you decided on a club to join yet?"
<USER>: "A club?"
<USER>: "I told you already, I'm really not--"
*I start to say what I always do - that I'm not interested in joining any clubs.*
*But something tells me Sayori would take more offense to that now.*
*After all, how could I tell her that clubs are a waste of time...*
*...when she's starting a club of her very own?*
<USER>: "...Actually, yeah."
<USER>: "I think I've decided on a club."
<USER>: "Hmm..."
<USER>: "I think I'll keep it a surprise."
Sayori: "You meanie."
<USER>: "Be patient, you'll find out soon enough."
*I used to ask myself why I let myself get lectured by such a carefree girl.*
*But I started to realize that in a way, I envy her.*
*When Sayori puts her mind to something, she can accomplish great things.*
*So that's why I feel like I should do something special for her.*
*The school day is as ordinary as ever, and it's over before I know it.*
*After I pack up my things, I stand up, gathering my motivation.*
<USER>: "Let's see..."
*I recall the room number of the club from a flier I saw.*
*I walk across the school and upstairs - a section of the school I rarely visit, being generally used for third-year classes and activities.*
*Before long, I find the room.*
*I timidly open the door in front of me.*
<USER>: "Hello...?"
Sayori: "Ah!"
Sayori: "<USER>...?!"
<USER>: "Well...I just--"
*Eh? I glance around the room.*
Natsuki: "Huh."
Natsuki: "So you're the <USER> that Sayori's always talking about?"
Yuri: "T-Thank you for stopping by!"
Yuri: "We're the Literature Club."
Natsuki: "No need to be so formal."
Natsuki: "He's gonna think we're really strict or something..."
Yuri: "Sorry, Natsuki..."
*The tall one, whose name is apparently Yuri, seems to be quite shy compared to the others.*
*In comparison, the girl named Natsuki - despite her size - seems like the assertive one.*
<USER>: "Well, it's nice to meet both of you."
<USER>: "I look forward to working with you."
Sayori: "You're..."
<USER>: "That's right."
<USER>: "The club I've decided to join is yours, Sayori."
<USER>: "The Literature Club."
*Sayori's eyes light up.*
*Sayori wraps her arms around me, jumping up and down.*
<USER>: "H-Hey--"
Natsuki: "Well, if Sayori is this happy, then I'm sure it won't be so bad to have you around."
Yuri: "That means we can become an officially-recognized club."
Sayori: "We have to celebrate!"
Yuri: "What an appropriate day for that, isn't it?"
*The girls have a few desks arranged to form a table.*
*Natsuki and Yuri walk over to the corner of the room, where Natsuki grabs a wrapped tray and Yuri opens the closet.*
*Still feeling awkward, I take a seat next to Sayori.*
*Natsuki proudly marches back to the table, tray in hand.*
Natsuki: "Okaaay, are you ready?"
Natsuki: "...Ta-daa!"
Sayori: "Uwooooah!"
*Natsuki lifts the foil off the tray to reveal a dozen white, fluffy cupcakes decorated to look like little cats.*
*The whiskers are drawn with icing, and little pieces of chocolate were used to make ears.*
<USER>: "Wow, those look amazing."
Natsuki: "Just hurry and take one!"
*Sayori grabs one first, then I follow.*
*Sayori talks with her mouth full and has already managed to get icing on her face.*
*I turn the cupcake around in my fingers, looking for the best angle to take a bite.*
*Natsuki is quiet.*
*I can't help but notice her sneaking glances in my direction.*
*Is she waiting for me to take a bite?*
*I finally bite down.*
*The icing is sweet and full of flavor - I wonder if she made it herself.*
<USER>: "This is really good."
<USER>: "Thank you, Natsuki."
Natsuki: "I'm a pro, after all!"
*As Natsuki struggles to accept the compliment, Yuri returns to the table, carrying a tea set.*
*She carefully places a teacup in front of each of us before setting down the teapot next to the cupcake tray.*
<USER>: "<USER> keep a whole tea set in this classroom?"
Yuri: "Don't worry, the teachers gave us permission."
Yuri: "After all, doesn't a hot cup of tea help you enjoy a good book?"
<USER>: "Ah... I-I guess..."
Natsuki: "Ehehe. Already trying to impress our new member, Yuri?"
*Insulted, Yuri looks away.*
<USER>: "I believe you."
<USER>: "Well, tea and reading might not be a pastime for me, but I at least enjoy tea."
*Yuri faintly smiles to herself in relief.*
<USER>: "Well... Ah..."
*Considering how little I've read these past few years, I don't really have a good way of answering that.*
<USER>: "...Manga..."
*I mutter quietly to myself, half-joking.*
*Natsuki's head suddenly perks up.*
*It looks like she wants to say something, but she keeps quiet.*
<USER>: "...Well, that can change..."
*What am I saying?*
*I spoke without thinking after seeing Yuri's sad smile.*
<USER>: "Anyway, what about you, Yuri?"
*Yuri traces the rim of her teacup with her finger.*
Yuri: "The level of creativity and craftsmanship behind them is amazing to me."
*Yuri goes on, clearly passionate about her reading.*
*She seemed so reserved and timid since the moment I walked in, but it's obvious by the way her eyes light up that she finds her comfort in the world of books, not people.*
Yuri: "I'm certain we can find something that we have in common."
Natsuki: "Hey, Yuri..."
<USER>: "Manga?"
Yuri: "Natsuki tends to read manga in the clubroom--"
*For some reason, Natsuki seems embarrassed about it.*
Natsuki: "Manga...is literature too, you know?"
Yuri: "I wouldn't do such a thing."
Yuri: "He can take this opportunity to try something new, as well."
Sayori: "M-Maybe--"
*Sensing the tension, Sayori jumps in.*
Sayori: "That's the kind of thing literature clubs do...right?"
Yuri: "I-I don't disagree or anything..."
Natsuki: "You're right as usual, President."
<USER>: "Well, that would make two of us..."
<USER>: "I wouldn't mind doing it if I'm not the only one."
Yuri: "I...I have to read manga...?"
Natsuki: "You should be a little more open-minded..."
Yuri: "..."
*With a guilty expression, Yuri thinks to herself.*
Yuri: "If...if you're into it, then I'm sure it's a worthy form of literature."
Yuri: "No..."
Yuri: "I've realized my error."
Natsuki: "It...makes me happy that you'd do that for me, Yuri."
Natsuki: "If you don't mind..."
Yuri: "I always go alone, so..."
Natsuki: "Yeah, me too..."
Sayori: "This is so cute~!"
<USER>: "Sayori, shut up..."
Yuri: "I look forward to it."
*Natsuki and Yuri start to clean up the food.*
Sayori: "Ehehe~"
<USER>: "Yeah, looks like it..."
<USER>: "It's nice to see everyone getting along."
<USER>: "<USER> think so...?"
<USER>: "Well, everyone always seems to get along a little better with you around, Sayori."
Sayori: "Don't say something like that, it's embarrassing!"
<USER>: "Well, whatever."
<USER>: "I was surprised when you told me you were starting a club..."
<USER>: "But I think you're pulling it off just fine."
Sayori: "I really want to thank you."
Sayori: "I mean, I'm really happy that you joined the club and everything..."
Sayori: "But the truth is, I already knew you were going to."

*It's the day of the festival.*
*Of all days, I expected this to be the one where I'd be walking to school with Sayori.*
*But Sayori isn't answering her phone.*
*I considered going to her house to wake her up, but decided that's a little too much.*
*Meanwhile, the preparations for the event should be nearly complete.*
*Funnily enough, I probably feel the same way as Natsuki about the event.*
*I'm more excited for it to be over so I can spend time with Sayori and [ch4_name] at the festival.*
*But knowing Monika, I'm sure the event will be great, too.*
Monika: "<USER>!"
Monika: "You're the first one here."
Monika: "Thanks for being early!"
<USER>: "That's funny, I thought at least Yuri would be here by now."
*Monika is placing little booklets on each of the desks in the classroom.*
*They must be the ones she prepared that have all the poems we're performing.*
*In the end, I found a random poem online that I thought Monika would like, and submitted it.*
*So, that's the one I'll be performing.*
<USER>: "Yeah, she overslept again..."
<USER>: "That dummy."
<USER>: "<USER>'d think that on days this important, she'd try a little harder..."
*I say that, but I suddenly remember what Sayori told me yesterday...*
*And I suddenly feel awful, knowing it's not nearly that simple for her.*
*I only said it because it's the way I'm used to thinking.*
*But...*
*Maybe I should have gone to wake her up after all?*
Monika: "I mean, especially after your exchange with her yesterday..."
Monika: "You kind of left her hanging this morning, you know?"
<USER>: "Exchange...?"
<USER>: "Monika-- <USER> know about that??"
Monika: "I'm the club president, after all."
<USER>: "But--!"
*I stammer, embarrassed.*
*Did Sayori really tell her about it that quickly?*
<USER>: "Jeez..."
<USER>: "<USER> don't know the full story at all, so..."
Monika: "I probably know a lot more than you think."
<USER>: "Eh...?"
*Monika is being as friendly as usual, but for some reason I felt a chill down my spine after hearing that.*
Monika: "They came out really nice!"
<USER>: "Yeah, sure."
*I grab one of the pamphlets laid out on the desks.*
<USER>: "Oh yeah, they really did."
<USER>: "Something like this will definitely help people take the club more seriously."
Monika: "Yeah, I thought so too!"
*I flip through the pages.*
*Each member's poem is neatly printed on its own page, giving it an almost professional feel.*
*I recognize Natsuki's and Yuri's poems from the ones they performed during our practice.*
<USER>: "What's this...?"
*I flip to Sayori's poem.*
*It's different from the one she practiced.*
*It's one that I haven't read before...*
<USER>: "Ah--"
*What is this...?*
*Reading the poem, I get a pit in my stomach.*
Monika: "<USER>?"
Monika: "What's wrong?"
<USER>: "Ah, nothing..."
*This poem feels completely different from everything else Sayori's written.*
*But more than that...*
<USER>: "I-I changed my mind!"
<USER>: "I'm going to go get Sayori, so..."
Monika: "Ah--"
Monika: "Try not to take too long, okay?"
*I quickly leave the classroom.*
Monika: "Don't strain yourself~"
*Monika calls that out after me.*
*I quicken my pace.*
*What was I thinking?*
*I should have tried a little bit harder for Sayori.*
*It's not a big deal to at least wait for her, or help her wake up.*
*Even the simple gesture of walking her to school makes her really happy.*
*Besides...*
*I told her yesterday that things will be the same as they always have been.*
*That's all she needs, and what I want to give her.*
*I reach Sayori's house and knock on the door.*
*I don't expect an answer, since she's not picking up her phone, either.*
*Like yesterday, I open the door and let myself in.*
<USER>: "Sayori?"
*She really is a heavy sleeper...*
*I swallow.*
*I can't believe I ended up doing this after all.*
*Waking her up in her own house...*
*In any case...*
*It just feels right.*
*Outside Sayori's room, I knock on her door.*
<USER>: "Sayori?"
<USER>: "Wake up, dummy..."
*There's no response.*
*I really didn't want to have to enter her room like this...*
*Isn't it kind of a breach of privacy?*
*But she really leaves me no choice.*
*I gently open the door.*
<USER>: "{cps=30}.......Sayo--{/cps}{nw}"
*...*
*What the hell...?*
*{i}What the hell??{/i}*
*Is this a nightmare?*
*It...has to be.*
*This isn't real.*
*There's no way this can be real.*
*Sayori wouldn't do this.*
*Everything was normal up until a few days ago.*
*That's why I can't believe what my eyes are showing me...!*
*I suppress the urge to vomit.*
*Just yesterday...*
*I told Sayori I would be there for her.*
*I told her I know what's best, and that everything will be okay.*
*Then why...?*
*Why would she do this...?*
*How could I be so helpless?*
*What did I do wrong?*
*Why was I so selfish?*
*This is my fault--!*
*My swarming thoughts keep telling me everything I could have done to prevent this.*
*If I just spent more time with her.*
*Walked her to school.*
*...Then I could have prevented this.*
*I know I could have prevented this!*
*Screw the Literature Club.*
*Screw the festival.*
*I just...lost my best friend.*
*Someone I grew up with.*
*She's gone forever now.*
*Nothing I do can bring her back.*
*This isn't some game where I can reset and try something different.*
*I had only one chance, and I wasn't careful enough.*
*And now I'll carry this guilt with me until I die.*
*Nothing in my life is worth more than hers...*
*But I still couldn't do what she needed from me.*
*And now...*
*I can never take it back.*
*Never.*
*Never.*
*Never.*
*Never.*
*Never...*
Natsuki: "Ugh...!"
*I hear Natsuki utter an exasperated sigh from within the closet.*
*She seems to be annoyed by something.*
*I approach her, in case she needs a hand.*
<USER>: "<USER> looking for something in there?"
Natsuki: "She never puts my stuff back in the right spot!"
Natsuki: "What's the point in keeping your collection organized if someone else is just gonna mess it up?"
*Natsuki slides a bunch of stacked books and boxes across the shelf.*
<USER>: "Manga..."
<USER>: "Ah--"
<USER>: "...Sometimes..."
*Manga is one of those things where you can't admit you're really into it until you figure out where the other person stands.*
<USER>: "...How did you know, anyway?"
Natsuki: "Besides, it's kind of written on your face."
*What's that supposed to mean...?*
<USER>: "I-I see..."
*There's a lone volume of manga amidst a stack of various books on the side of one of the shelves.*
*Curious, I pull it out of the stack.*
*Natsuki snatches it out of my hand.*
*She then turns to a box of manga and slips the volume right into the middle of the rest.*
Natsuki: "Seeing a box set with one book missing is probably the most irritating sight in the world."
<USER>: "I know that feel..."
*I get a closer look at the box set she's admiring.*
<USER>: "Parfait Girls...?"
*It's a series I've never heard of in my life.*
*That probably means it's either way out of my demographic, or it's simply terrible.*
*She points to the classroom door.*
<USER>: "H-Hey, I wasn't judging anything...!"
<USER>: "I didn't even say anything."
Natsuki: "But I'll tell you one thing, <USER>."
Natsuki: "In fact--"
*Natsuki pulls out the first volume of Parfait Girls from the box.*
Natsuki: "I'm gonna show you exactly why!"
*She shoves the book right into my hands.*
<USER>: "Ah..."
*I stare at the cover.*
*It features four girls in colorful attire striking animated feminine poses.*
*It's...exceedingly \*moe\*.*
<USER>: "Uwa--"
*Natsuki grabs my arm and pulls me out of the closet.*
*She then takes a seat against the wall, beneath the windowsills.*
*She pats on the ground next to her, signaling me to sit there.*
<USER>: "Wouldn't chairs be more comfortable...?"
*I take my seat.*
Natsuki: "We can't read at the same time like that."
<USER>: "Eh? Why's that?"
<USER>: "Ah...I guess it's easier to be close together like this..."
Natsuki: "You'll make me feel weird about it!"
*Natsuki crosses her arms and scootches an inch away from me.*
<USER>: "Sorry..."
*I didn't exactly expect to be sitting this close to her, either...*
*Not that I can say it's a particularly bad thing.*
*I open the book.*
*It's only a few seconds before Natsuki once again inches closer, reclaiming the additional space while she hopes I won't notice.*
*I can feel her peering over my shoulder, much more eager to begin reading than I am.*
<USER>: "Hm?"
<USER>: "<USER> don't go back and flip through the older volumes every now and then?"
Natsuki: "Maybe sometimes after I've already finished the series."
<USER>: "Uh..."
*I am, but nothing's really happened yet, so I can talk at the same time.*
*It looks like it's about a bunch of friends in high school.*
*Typical slice-of-life affair.*
*I kind of grew out of these, since it's rare for the writing to be entertaining enough to make up for the lack of plot.*
<USER>: "So..."
<USER>: "What should I expect from this?"
<USER>: "Is there going to be plot?"
Natsuki: "You think I would enjoy something that didn't have a plot?"
Natsuki: "Like there's a really funny chapter where they're obsessed with a guy at the ice cream shop..."
Natsuki: "And besides, it's still entertaining."
Natsuki: "Like when they get into all their backstories, and when some of the romance starts to happen..."
Natsuki: "That's really what makes it so good."
<USER>: "Ah, is that so?"
<USER>: "It sounds like you really know what you're talking about."
<USER>: "Maybe I underestimated you."
Natsuki: "What's {i}that{/i} supposed to mean?!"
<USER>: "Uwa--"
*Natsuki gives me a little shove.*
<USER>: "I just meant that I haven't yet seen you at your full power..."
<USER>: "Ah... This chapter seems like it's about baking."
<USER>: "This is just a guess, but is there a lot of baking in this manga?"
*Natsuki pauses for a moment, as if she doesn't want to admit something.*
Natsuki: "Why does that matter?"
<USER>: "It doesn't, I was just curious..."
<USER>: "Since you enjoy baking too, right?"
Natsuki: "Just a coincidence!"
Natsuki: "Like I would ever get into anything because it's in a manga."
Natsuki: "Ahaha!"
*Definitely not a coincidence...*
*I guess that explains Natsuki's interest in baking.*
*Still, of all the hobbies to pick up from a manga, that's definitely one of the better ones.*
*Not to mention she's really good at it, so who am I to judge?*
*...*
*We read on for a few more minutes.*
*I've finished a couple chapters at this point.*
<USER>: "..."
<USER>: "...Are you sure this isn't boring for you?"
Natsuki: "It's not!"
<USER>: "Even though you're just watching me read?"
Natsuki: "Well...!"
Natsuki: "I'm...fine with that."
<USER>: "If you say so..."
<USER>: "...I guess it's fun sharing something you like with someone else."
<USER>: "I always get excited when I convince any of my friends to pick up a series I enjoy."
<USER>: "<USER> know what I mean?"
Natsuki: "...?"
<USER>: "Hm?"
<USER>: "<USER> don't?"
Natsuki: "Um..."
Natsuki: "That's not..."
Natsuki: "Well, I wouldn't really know."
<USER>: "...What do you mean?"
<USER>: "Don't you share your manga with your friends?"
Natsuki: "Could you not rub it in?"
Natsuki: "Jeez..."
<USER>: "Ah... Sorry..."
Natsuki: "Hmph."
Natsuki: "Like I could ever get my friends to read this..."
Natsuki: "They just think manga is for kids."
Natsuki: "I can't even bring it up without them being all like..."
Natsuki: "'Eh? You still haven't grown out of that yet?'"
Natsuki: "Makes me want to punch them in the face..."
<USER>: "Urgh, I know those kinds of people..."
<USER>: "Honestly, it takes a lot of effort to find friends who don't judge, much less friends who are also into it..."
<USER>: "I'm already kind of a loser, so I guess I gravitated toward the other losers over time."
<USER>: "But it's probably harder for someone like you..."
Natsuki: "Hm."
Natsuki: "Yeah, that's pretty accurate."
*{i}...Wait, which part??{/i}*
Natsuki: "I mean, I feel like I can't even keep it in my own room..."
Natsuki: "I don't even know what my dad would do if he found this."
Natsuki: "At least it's safe here in the clubroom."
Natsuki: "'Cept Monika was kind of a jerk about it..."
Natsuki: "Ugh! I just can't win, can I?"
<USER>: "Well, it paid off in the end, didn't it?"
<USER>: "I mean, here I am, reading it."
Natsuki: "Well, it's not like that solves any of my problems."
<USER>: "Maybe..."
<USER>: "But at least you're enjoying yourself, right?"
Natsuki: "--"
Natsuki: "..."
Natsuki: "...So?"
<USER>: "Ahaha."
Natsuki: "Jeez, that's enough!"
Natsuki: "Are you gonna keep reading, or what?"
<USER>: "Yeah, yeah..."
*I flip the page.*
*Suddenly, Natsuki starts laughing.*
Natsuki: "Ahahaha!"
Natsuki: "I totally forgot that happens!"
*Natsuki puts her finger on one of the panels.*
Natsuki: "Minori is my favorite character."
Natsuki: "You always feel a little bad for her, since she's so unlucky."
Natsuki: "But it gets especially bad when--"
Natsuki: "Uu..."
Natsuki: "I shouldn't be talking about that yet!"
Natsuki: "Just finish this chapter!"
*Natsuki's voice sparkles with excitement.*
*It's a stark contrast to her usual bossy tone.*
*But if she's not used to sharing her favorite manga with her friends, I can understand why.*
*It's hard to express in words the feeling you get when connecting with someone like that.*
*And being able to provide that to Natsuki, for whom it's a rare experience...*
*The thought makes me smile a little to myself.*
Monika: "Okay, everyone!"
<USER>: "Eh?"
Monika: "Are you all ready with today's poems?"
<USER>: "..."
Natsuki: "Oh, come on!"
Natsuki: "Could your timing be any worse?"
Monika: "I just need to make sure we have enough time."
Monika: "Though you do look pretty cozy over there. Ahaha!"
*Natsuki suddenly notices how close she's gotten to me.*
*She hastily slides herself a good twelve inches away from me.*
<USER>: "Alright..."
<USER>: "Guess I'll stop here for now."
*I close the book and hand it towards Natsuki.*
Natsuki: "Don't you want to know what happens?"
<USER>: "Ah... Yeah, but..."
<USER>: "Monika just said--"
Natsuki: "Just take it home with you."
<USER>: "Eh?"
<USER>: "...Is that really alright?"
*I say that mostly because I really didn't plan on using my spare time to read this...*
Natsuki: "It would take forever to finish if you didn't take it home."
Natsuki: "Just finish that one before tomorrow, so we can start the next one."
<USER>: "By tomorrow...?"
*I only got partway through the volume so far.*
*I might fall behind on some shows if I try to get through this...*
*But I suppose that's a necessary sacrifice in exchange for seeing Natsuki's enthusiastic face.*
*Or am I more scared of what will happen if I {i}don't{/i} finish it...?*
<USER>: "Alright, then!"
*I stand up.*
*I return to where I put my stuff and carefully slip the book into my bag.*
Natsuki: "..."
*It's not long before Natsuki comes up to me expectantly.*
<USER>: "Yeah, yeah."
<USER>: "Don't worry, I kept my promise."
*I pull the first volume of Parfait Girls out from my bag.*
*Natsuki takes it from my hands, then quickly turns it over, presumably to check for wrinkles.*
<USER>: "Hey, I'm not that careless..."
<USER>: "I handle manga all the time, you know."
Natsuki: "I don't give people my manga every day, you know."
<USER>: "That's true..."
<USER>: "I don't blame you."
Natsuki: "I'm gonna get the next one, okay?"
*Natsuki makes her way to the closet.*
*I follow.*
Natsuki: "So you're gonna tell me everything you thought, right??"
<USER>: "Ah, the chapter ended when Minori and Alice found--"
Natsuki: "{i}Monika!!{/i}"
*Natsuki's voice resonates out from inside the closet.*
<USER>: "Eh...?"
*I peer inside.*
*All of Natsuki's books are lined up on the top shelf.*
Natsuki: "Did you move my manga again?!"
Monika: "Ah, sorry, sorry!"
Monika: "The teacher got mad at me for taking up so much space in her closet..."
Monika: "So I had to move some stuff around and clean up a little bit."
*The top shelf is far above Natsuki's head.*
*She makes a futile hop, trying to figure out how to reach her manga.*
Natsuki: "This is so inconvenient!"
Natsuki: "There's plenty of room on these shelves."
Natsuki: "And besides..."
Natsuki: "Why would you waste that on the top shelf?"
<USER>: "Ah, Natsuki..."
<USER>: "There's a stool on the wall there."
*In the closet, there's a collapsible stool that's hanging on the wall.*
<USER>: "If you want, I can reach up there and hand them to you..."
*Natsuki grabs the stool from the wall and unfolds it.*
Natsuki: "You think I'm too short or something?"
<USER>: "I mean--"
Natsuki: "Just watch me!"
*Natsuki hops onto the stool, which ends up being a little wobbly because of its collapsible design.*
<USER>: "Careful..."
*Standing on the stool, Natsuki's fingertips reach the top shelf.*
*The stool would be enough for me to easily grab the books, but Natsuki is being stubborn as usual.*
Natsuki: "U-Uuuh..."
*Natsuki uses her fingers to scoot one of the smaller boxes to the edge of the shelf.*
*The box suddenly tips.*
*Natsuki barely catches it before it falls to the floor.*
*The stool wobbles.*
Natsuki: "Wawaa--"
*Losing balance, Natsuki hops off the stool.*
*Thankfully, she was able to stay on her feet.*
*She holds the box triumphantly.*
*Having almost fell, Natsuki is a bit shaken up.*
<USER>: "Jeez..."
<USER>: "No need to prove yourself to me."
<USER>: "There's no way you'll be able to get the bigger boxes like that."
<USER>: "I can reach them, so just--"
Natsuki: "I don't want your help, okay?"
<USER>: "Sigh..."
Natsuki: "I'm gonna get a chair, so just hang on."
*Natsuki forces her way past me out of the closet.*
Natsuki: "Let's see..."
*The classroom chairs have the desks attached, so they're too inconvenient to fit into the closet.*
Natsuki: "Aha!"
*Natsuki trots over to the teacher's desk, which has a computer chair behind it.*
*She rolls it on its wheels back over to the closet.*
<USER>: "Ah--"
*It's a little dangerous, since the chair swivels and rolls.*
*But I've already learned my lesson, so I keep my mouth shut.*
*Natsuki climbs onto the chair, then slowly balances onto her feet.*
*Since she refuses my help, I take a seat with my back against the side of the doorway and simply watch.*
Natsuki: "Aha! There we go!"
Natsuki: "See? I can easily do it now."
*Natsuki grabs a stack of manga and bends down to put it on the shelf below.*
Natsuki: "W-Wahh--"
*The chair swivels.*
*Natsuki catches herself on the shelf.*
Natsuki: "What are you doing??"
Natsuki: "Can you at least hold the chair steady instead of sitting and doing nothing?"
*{i}(Who was it who told me not to help...?){/i}*
<USER>: "Yeah, yeah...I got you."
*I hold the chair while Natsuki reaches back up.*
<USER>: "--!"
*I can...*
*{i}I can almost see up her skirt?!{/i}*
<USER>: "Guh--"
*I force myself to turn away.*
*Natsuki seriously didn't think this through...!*
*Once she realizes, I'll be dead!*
Natsuki: "Hup--"
*Natsuki wraps her arms around the Parfait Girls box set, easily the largest one on the shelf.*
Natsuki: "Uu...heavy..."
Natsuki: "Hey, <USER>..."
Natsuki: "I-I don't think I can bend down without falling...!"
Natsuki: "Hurry and take this one..."
<USER>: "Eh?"
<USER>: "But then I have to let go of the chair..."
Natsuki: "That's fine...!"
Natsuki: "Just for a second!"
Natsuki: "Hurry up..."
<USER>: "Alright...!"
<USER>: "Let me just stand up."
*I slowly release my grip from the chair.*
Natsuki: "What do you mean 'stand up'?"
*Natsuki looks down at me.*
Natsuki: "Why are you all the way back--"
Natsuki: "E-Eh...?"
*Natsuki looks like she just realized something, but she'll lose her balance if she moves.*
<USER>: "Natsuki, the box--"
Natsuki: "{i}W-What are you looking at?!{/i}"
<USER>: "--!"
Natsuki: "You're trying to look at my...m-my..."
*Natsuki's legs shake.*
<USER>: "I-I'm not! I was just--"
<USER>: "--Natsuki, don't try to move!"
<USER>: "Just give me the box!"
Natsuki: "You...you perv!"
Natsuki: "You set me up!!"
Natsuki: "Go away!"
Natsuki: "Get out!"
<USER>: "But--"
Natsuki: "I'll do it myself!!"
Natsuki: "A-Ah--"
*The chair suddenly swivels beneath Natsuki's feet.*
<USER>: "Natsuki--!"
Natsuki: "{i}Kyaaaaa!{/i}"
*The scene turns to chaos in a split second.*
*The chair flies from under Natsuki's feet.*
*Frantically, I try to catch her.*
*The box topples out of her hands, and the books go flying.*
<USER>: "I got you--"
*{i}Crash!{/i}*
*The full force of Natsuki's body against me throws me to the ground.*
*A whole bunch of books pelt me in the face.*
*Natsuki tries to shield herself with her own arms as her face lands straight on my chest.*
<USER>: "Ungh..."
*My right arm and my back seriously felt the impact.*
Natsuki: "U-Uu..."
*Slowly, Natsuki comes to her senses.*
<USER>: "Ghk--!"
*She presses her arms straight into me to prop herself up.*
*Natsuki seems to realize that it's not the floor that's beneath her.*
Natsuki: "Gross! Gross!"
<USER>: "Ghak--!"
*A fist pounds into my chest.*
*Natsuki then hoists herself to her feet.*
Natsuki: "What were you thinking?!"
Natsuki: "You sicko!"
Monika: "Everything okay over there...?"
Monika: "I heard a loud noise..."
*Monika suddenly peers in.*
Natsuki: "See what happens when you put the manga on the top shelf?!"
Natsuki: "Jeez!"
Monika: "Ahaha..."
Natsuki: "It seems like your most recent club member is a total pervert."
Natsuki: "So I hope you're happy."
<USER>: "I didn't--!"
*Somehow, it's impossible for me to explain this whole bizarre situation to Monika.*
<USER>: "I didn't do anything, I swear...!"
*Monika says that quietly to me.*
*Looks like I'm off the hook...*
Natsuki: "My...my..."
<USER>: "Eh?"
*I look down.*
*Natsuki is kneeling on the floor, holding one of the books that are scattered all over.*
*There's a large diagonal crease along the page that she's desperately trying to smooth out.*
<USER>: "Ah, it must have landed on the page..."
*Natsuki tries a bit more to fix the crease, but she can't get it out.*
*Suddenly, she gives up and slams the book shut, then throws it to the floor.*
*Instead of continuing to yell, she just lowers her head.*
Natsuki: "{i}*Sob*{/i}"
<USER>: "...Natsuki, are you--"
*Natsuki's voice squeaks.*
*I see tears on her face.*
<USER>: "Ah..."
<USER>: "I'll help get the crease out, okay?"
<USER>: "It's partially my fault, so..."
*Natsuki shakes her head, still looking down.*
Natsuki: "No..."
Natsuki: "I don't even care that much..."
Natsuki: "I'm just..."
Natsuki: "Having a really bad day today..."
*Natsuki sobs again.*
Natsuki: "I really didn't mean to!"
<USER>: "It's...it's fine."
<USER>: "...Is there anything you want to talk about?"
*Natsuki shakes her head.*
Natsuki: "Just..."
Natsuki: "Every day..."
Natsuki: "...is...so hard."
Natsuki: "I just want to..."
Natsuki: "...come to the club and..."
Natsuki: "..."
*Natsuki falls silent again.*
*I can't press her, so I can only do what I know how to do.*
<USER>: "Alright..."
<USER>: "Well, I'll help clean this up."
<USER>: "And I'll move the rest of your manga for you."
<USER>: "Ah."
*I pick up volume 2 of Parfait Girls.*
<USER>: "We'll set this one aside."
<USER>: "This'll help cheer you up a bit, right?"
<USER>: "We can get started on it once I'm done here."
*Natsuki looks up with her glossy eyes.*
*Her lip quivers.*
Natsuki: "You're..."
Natsuki: "You're really nice to me..."
<USER>: "Eh?"
*That sounds really strange, coming from Natsuki.*
*I didn't expect it at all.*
<USER>: "Well..."
<USER>: "I'm just treating you like a friend, you know?"
*Natsuki lowers her head and stifles another sob.*
*I'm not sure what happened to her today, but being nice is the least I could do.*
*The next couple minutes are silent between us as I begin gathering the scattered books.*
*I make sure to slip them into the box in their correct order.*
*After a little bit, Natsuki starts helping.*
*It isn't long before we're done, and I hoist the box onto the shelf where Natsuki wanted to put it.*
*Then, I get on the stool and quickly finish moving the rest of her books from the top shelf.*
<USER>: "Alright--!"
<USER>: "That should do it."
*I hop off the stool.*
*Natsuki averts her gaze.*
Natsuki: "T-Thanks..."
<USER>: "Ahaha..."
<USER>: "It's nothing."
*Natsuki is holding the volume I set aside in her hands.*
<USER>: "Alright, I'm ready."
Natsuki: "Even if you weren't, I'd make you anyway."
Natsuki: "The thing about cheering me up."
<USER>: "If you insist!"
*We sit in the same spot as last time, and I open the second volume.*
*Natsuki's mood quickly improves, laughing and pointing things out to me.*
*She's surprisingly sharp, making note of a lot of subtle repeated jokes and background elements.*
*In the end, I'm pretty impressed by how everything ties together in this manga.*
*I guess Natsuki has good taste after all.*
*After some time, Monika gets our attention as usual, and it's time to share poems again.*
<USER>: "Guess I'll be holding onto this for now."
Natsuki: "Yep!"
Natsuki: "Even you sound more enthusiastic this time."
<USER>: "Well, I'm starting to get into it, you know."
Natsuki: "Told you."
<USER>: "Yeah, yeah..."
*I return to my seat and slip the book into my bag.*
*Man...*
*It looks like no one wants to be bothered today.*
*I slump down into the nearest desk.*
*How am I supposed to occupy myself with something literature-related by myself like this?*
*I guess I could always read some of the book Yuri gave me...*
*...But I'm feeling a little too tired to read.*
*I could probably fall asleep right now.*
*I close my eyes and end up listening in on Sayori's conversation with Monika.*
Sayori: "We're probably gonna seem really lame compared to all the other clubs, though..."
Monika: "Hmm..."
Monika: "The festival is our chance to show everyone what literature is all about!"
Monika: "But it's not like that at all, you know?"
Monika: "Something that speaks to their creative minds."
Sayori: "That doesn't solve the problem, though!"
Sayori: "Nobody will come in the first place if it's a literature event."
Sayori: "So it's more important to figure out how to get people to show up in the first place, you know?"
*...What's this?*
*Sayori is taking this really seriously.*
*It's rare to hear her deliberating like this.*
Monika: "In that case, do you think food will do the trick?"
Sayori: "Cupcakes!"
Monika: "Ahaha. Good thinking."
Sayori: "Natsuki makes the best cupcakes!"
Sayori: "That works out perfectly~"
Monika: "Cupcakes it is, then."
*I find myself smiling.*
*In the end, Sayori is still her usual self.*
*But therein lies the unexpected reason I admire her.*
*Unlike me, who has trouble finding any motivation at all...*
*Sayori can put her mind to things and make them come to life.*
*I suppose that's why I end up letting her get on my case about things.*
*I can't help but wonder what it would be like to see the world through her eyes...*
<USER>: "Uwaa--!"
*I open my eyes to find Sayori's face filling my vision.*
*I nearly fall out of my chair.*
Sayori: "It's your fault for sleeping like that!"
Sayori: "This isn't the napping club!"
<USER>: "Does our school have a napping club...?"
Sayori: "Now that you're in a club, you're gonna have less time for anime, you know!"
Sayori: "You'll need to get used to it!"
<USER>: "Don't say that so loud...!"
*I glance over my shoulder to see if Monika overheard.*
<USER>: "Yeah..."
<USER>: "I know, I know."
<USER>: "<USER>'re always looking out for me, Sayori."
Sayori: "It's what I do best!"
<USER>: "...That's a problem!"
<USER>: "What about you?"
<USER>: "<USER> look out for me better than you look out for yourself."
<USER>: "<USER>'re still oversleeping every day, aren't you?"
Sayori: "N-Not every day!"
<USER>: "That's not very convincing..."
<USER>: "How many days this past week have you gotten up on time?"
<USER>: "I knew it..."
Sayori: "At least give me the benefit of the doubt..."
<USER>: "I can't even do that."
<USER>: "Look, Sayori, it's written all over you."
*Sayori glances around at herself.*
Sayori: "How is it written all over me?"
<USER>: "<USER> were clearly in a rush this morning..."
<USER>: "Look, your hair is sticking out all around here."
*I run my fingertips down the side of Sayori's hair, trying to straighten it out.*
<USER>: "Man, you really need a brush for this..."
<USER>: "I won't fall for that."
<USER>: "There's more than just your hair."
<USER>: "Look, your bow isn't straight, either."
<USER>: "And there's a toothpaste stain on your collar right here."
*I try to wipe off the stain with my finger.*
Sayori: "B-But nobody would ever notice that..."
<USER>: "Of course they would."
<USER>: "Nobody's gonna tell you about it because they don't want to embarrass you."
<USER>: "Fortunately, I really don't care about that."
<USER>: "And you don't even keep your blazer buttoned up."
<USER>: "Seriously, Sayori..."
<USER>: "Why do you think you don't have a boyfriend yet?"
Sayori: "Eh??"
Sayori: "That's {i}super{/i} mean!"
<USER>: "Sorry, but you'll thank me later..."
*I start to button her blazer from the bottom.*
<USER>: "Once you see how much better it looks, you'll change your mind."
Sayori: "Ehehe~"
Sayori: "This is so funny."
<USER>: "What is?"
Sayori: "Well..."
Sayori: "I was just thinking how weird it is to have a friend who does these kinds of things."
<USER>: "Eh?"
<USER>: "D-Don't say that!"
<USER>: "<USER>'ll make {i}me{/i} feel weird about it, stupid..."
Sayori: "It's okay, though."
Sayori: "I'm happy we're like this."
Sayori: "Aren't you?"
<USER>: "Ah--"
<USER>: "I-I guess..."
Sayori: "Hey, be careful..."
Sayori: "The button might come off!"
<USER>: "Why is this one so hard to close...?"
*I struggle to fully close the button near her chest.*
<USER>: "Does this thing even fit you properly?"
Sayori: "Ehehe~"
Sayori: "It did when I bought it."
<USER>: "Sigh..."
<USER>: "If you ever buttoned it, you would have noticed sooner that it doesn't fit you anymore."
<USER>: "What are you smiling about?"
Sayori: "It means my boobs got bigger again!"
<USER>: "D-Don't say that out loud!!"
Sayori: "Ehehe~"
<USER>: "Anyway..."
<USER>: "<USER> look much better now, so..."
<USER>: "Ah..."
*...Why does it feel strange to see Sayori's blazer buttoned up like that?*
Sayori: "But it's so stuffy..."
Sayori: "Uuu..."
Sayori: "It's not worth it at all!"
*Sayori hastily unbuttons her blazer once more.*
Sayori: "Phew!"
Sayori: "That's so much better~"
*Sayori puts her arms out and twirls around.*
<USER>: "What kind of logic is that?"
<USER>: "And why are you saying that like it's a good thing?"
Sayori: "Because..."
Sayori: "So that's why I'm keeping it unbuttoned!"
<USER>: "Stop saying all these embarrassing things!"
Sayori: "I didn't say anything embarrassing..."
<USER>: "Jeez..."
<USER>: "Well anyway, just focus on trying to wake up a little earlier..."
<USER>: "Fine, fine..."
<USER>: "It's a deal."
<USER>: "Yeah, I guess so, huh..."
<USER>: "<USER>'re doing it again, Sayori..."
<USER>: "Man, it's impossible to tell with you sometimes."
Monika: "Okay, everyone!"
<USER>: "Eh?"
*Monika suddenly calls out.*
Monika: "Why don't we share the poems we wrote now?"
Sayori: "Yay~!"
<USER>: "Yeah, same..."
*I fail to sound enthusiastic, but Sayori still trots away to retrieve her poem.*
Sayori: "<USER>, <USER>!"
*Sayori suddenly comes up to me.*
Sayori: "I'm gonna go get some supplies from another classroom."
Sayori: "Want to come with me?"
<USER>: "Supplies?"
<USER>: "What for?"
Sayori: "Me and Monika were gonna make some posters and stuff."
Sayori: "So I need to go find some crayons, and markers, and glue sticks..."
<USER>: "Ah, I see."
<USER>: "Sure, I'll go with you."
Monika: "Ah, are you going with <USER> to get the supplies?"
Monika: "There's no need to trouble yourself."
Monika: "I'd be happy to go with him."
Sayori: "Aw, but I wanted to go!"
Sayori: "It's so much fun exploring empty classrooms and stuff!"
Monika: "See if you can find poster paper too, okay?"
<USER>: "Yep, let's go."
*Sayori and I exit the clubroom.*
*I follow behind as Sayori hums and skips around the hallway.*
*Honestly...*
*It feels like I'm taking a kid to the mall or something.*
*Sayori finds pleasure in the simplest things sometimes.*
<USER>: "Hey, Sayori..."
<USER>: "What exactly are we doing for the festival, anyway?"
<USER>: "I'm not sure how you would make an event out of literature..."
Sayori: "Don't you worry~"
<USER>: "Is that so...?"
Sayori: "Yup!"
Sayori: "We're gonna do a poetry performance!"
<USER>: "A performance...?"
<USER>: "Of what kind?"
Sayori: "Everyone is gonna take turns on stage..."
<USER>: "Ah..."
<USER>: "That sounds..."
*...Kind of dull?*
Sayori: "You're not thinking about it the right way at all!"
Sayori: "It's not just about reading poems..."
Sayori: "Like, you say the lines of the poem like..."
Sayori: "{i}The last remaining flower beckons to me.{/i}"
Sayori: "{i}Caressing the final joyous moment between my fingers.{/i}"
Sayori: "{i}For now when I look in every direction...{/i}"
Sayori: "..."
<USER>: "Sayori..."
*How do I put this...*
<USER>: "I'm sure it's just me, but it's impossible for me to take you seriously when you talk like that..."
Sayori: "Ehhh?"
Sayori: "You meanie!"
Sayori: "I'm working super hard on this, you know!"
<USER>: "Ah, I know, I know!"
<USER>: "I just meant that it's a pretty unordinary contrast to your cute self."
Sayori: "Ahaha! Don't say that, it's embarrassing!"
<USER>: "Yeah, I guess so..."
Sayori: "The festival is going to be so much fun~"
*Sayori spins herself around in the hallway again.*
Sayori: "Let's begin the mission!"
<USER>: "The mission, eh...?"
*It's been a long time since I've spent time with Sayori like this.*
*But in the end, she hasn't changed one bit.*
*She's nothing but a ball of sunshine, drawing happy vibes from the world around her.*
*It's a pretty nostalgic feeling for me.*
*As the years went by, I began to hole myself up in my room more and more.*
*So going adventuring with Sayori brings about a special sort of feeling I forgot I had in me.*
*The two of us enter the classroom.*
*Sayori heads straight to the closet, and I follow.*
Sayori: "Let's see what we have in here..."
*Sayori pulls a box full of crayons off the shelf.*
Sayori: "They're the best brand, too!"
*Sayori starts pulling various crayons out of the box, reading the color names.*
<USER>: "Alright, that's one down."
<USER>: "Don't get distracted, we still need to find--"
<USER>: "Fine, fine..."
<USER>: "Then at least move aside so I can look for the poster paper."
*{i}Smack!{/i}*
Sayori: "Kya--!"
*Sayori bends over and smacks her forehead right into the shelf.*
*She falls to the floor, and the crayons spill all over her lap.*
Sayori: "Owowowowow..."
<USER>: "<USER> okay?"
Sayori: "My forehead..."
*Sayori clutches her forehead.*
<USER>: "Jeez, Sayori..."
<USER>: "That's just like you, isn't it?"
<USER>: "C'mon, let me see."
*Since Sayori is sitting on the floor, I grab her by the waist and pull her out of the closet.*
<USER>: "<USER> have to move your hands, Sayori..."
<USER>: "Just do it for a second."
*Sayori slowly releases her hands from her forehead.*
*I gently brush her bangs to the side.*
Sayori: "Ow--!"
<USER>: "Sorry..."
*There's a huge red mark on the center of her forehead.*
*A bump is starting to form, as well.*
<USER>: "Man, that's gonna swell up."
<USER>: "I should find you some ice..."
Sayori: "<USER>..."
<USER>: "Where would I even find ice around this time...?"
<USER>: "Ah, I guess a cold drink would do..."
Sayori: "You don't have to--!"
Sayori: "I'm fine with--looking like a unicorn--"
*Even wincing from the pain, Sayori makes a silly joke.*
<USER>: "Ahaha, what are you saying?"
<USER>: "I'll be right back, okay?"
Sayori: "O-Okay..."
*I pat Sayori on the shoulder and run out into the hallway.*
*I locate the nearest vending machine.*
<USER>: "What should I get...?"
*It doesn't really matter, since it will be used as an ice pack, rather than to drink.*
*But I know Sayori likes apple juice, so I purchase that one.*
*In just a moment, I'm already returning to the classroom where I left Sayori.*
*She has one palm on her forehead and is using the other hand to clumsily scoop crayons back into the box.*
Sayori: "At least they were already in the wrong spots before I spilled them..."
<USER>: "Sayori, here."
*I hand Sayori the bottle of apple juice.*
Sayori: "It's nice and cold..."
*Sayori opens the cap and starts drinking from it.*
<USER>: "Sayori, what are you doing?!"
<USER>: "It's for your forehead, idiot!"
Sayori: "Ah--"
Sayori: "Sorry, I forgot~"
Sayori: "Ahahaha!"
<USER>: "How hard did you hit your head...?"
*Sayori places the bottle against the bump on her head.*
Sayori: "It stings..."
<USER>: "Just bear with it, it'll feel better soon."
<USER>: "Looks like you cleaned up most of the crayons, so that's good."
Sayori: "Hey, <USER>..."
Sayori: "This kind of reminds you of growing up, doesn't it...?"
<USER>: "Eh? What do you mean?"
Sayori: "You know how we used to play outside all the time..."
Sayori: "I would always try to keep up with you."
Sayori: "You were kind of oblivious in some ways..."
Sayori: "Like I usually fell behind or had trouble climbing on the things you did..."
Sayori: "But sometimes when I tried to do things I couldn't, I would get myself hurt."
Sayori: "I'd fall and scrape myself, or get a bump..."
Sayori: "And I would start crying really hard."
Sayori: "Ahaha!"
Sayori: "And you would rush over as quick as you could."
Sayori: "You would try really hard to get me to stop crying."
Sayori: "It was almost like you blamed yourself and were afraid of getting in trouble if someone found out..."
Sayori: "Even though it really wasn't your fault at all, you know?"
<USER>: "Did I really do that...?"
Sayori: "Yeah...you don't remember?"
<USER>: "Come to think of it, maybe I do remember a bit..."
<USER>: "I guess I was always so focused on my games that I didn't pay enough attention to you."
<USER>: "So in a way, it was my fault."
<USER>: "Kind of like this time, too..."
<USER>: "If I wasn't rushing you out of the closet, you probably wouldn't have hit your head."
Sayori: "<USER>..."
Sayori: "I don't think you realize it, but you're always thinking about other people."
Sayori: "Even after all these years..."
Sayori: "You're rushing to help me, even though I'm just being clumsy."
Sayori: "You're really a sweetheart..."
<USER>: "D-Don't call me that!"
<USER>: "And I don't really do this kind of thing all the time..."
<USER>: "I guess when it comes to you, it just feels natural."
<USER>: "Before I even know it, I'm treating you like that."
<USER>: "I guess that's what happens when you've been friends for so long."
Sayori: "Really...?"
Sayori: "Maybe you're right..."
Sayori: "<USER>..."
Sayori: "I'm so glad that nothing's changed between us."
Sayori: "Do you think it'll be like this forever?"
<USER>: "Forever...?"
*If I'm honest to myself...*
*There's no telling where we'll each end up for college, or after that.*
*So it wouldn't be fair for me to make any promises.*
*But...*
<USER>: "Well, I hope so."
<USER>: "It's been this long already, right?"
<USER>: "I can't imagine you ever changing, so my hopes are up."
Sayori: "I'm so happy..."
*Sayori has a whimsical expression in her eyes.*
*We remain silent for a moment.*
*She's so silly and clumsy on the outside that when I see her deep in thought like this...*
*It makes me not want to disturb her.*
Sayori: "I guess we should go back..."
Sayori: "I don't want to worry Monika, you know?"
<USER>: "Good luck with that."
<USER>: "She's gonna see your forehead either way."
Sayori: "Not if I hide it under my bangs~"
*Sayori hops to her feet.*
Sayori: "A-Aaahh--!"
*She clutches her forehead again.*
<USER>: "Don't stand up so fast after hurting yourself!"
Sayori: "Uuuu..."
<USER>: "Well, I guess it's too late now..."
<USER>: "Anyway, let's go."
*I follow Sayori out of the classroom.*
*Sayori plays with her bangs to try to hide the bump, but without much success.*
*In a moment, we make it back to the clubroom.*
Monika: "Ah, you're back!"
Monika: "Good timing, I was just about ready to start with sharing our poems."
<USER>: "She's fine, don't worry about--"
Sayori: "I was playing with the crayons and smacked my forehead into the shelf!"
<USER>: "..."
Monika: "..."
Sayori: "Uh-huh! I have it right--"
*Sayori frantically glances around herself.*
Sayori: "I...forgot all of the stuff!!"
<USER>: "Calm down, Sayori."
<USER>: "I have it all right here."
<USER>: "I found the poster paper, too."
Monika: "Ahaha!"
Monika: "Sounds like you ended up doing all the work, <USER>."
<USER>: "Ah, well, Sayori--"
*I fail to come up with an excuse for Sayori.*
Sayori: "I made it an adventure!"
<USER>: "...Yeah, that."
Monika: "Ahaha, okay, okay."
Monika: "I'll start working on the posters tonight."
Sayori: "Me too!"
Monika: "Are you ready to share your poems?"
<USER>: "Guess I should grab mine..."
*After making sure the crayon box is closed tightly, I return to my seat.*
*I'm really curious to talk to Yuri a little bit more...*
*But at the same time, I would feel bad for distracting her from reading.*
*I catch a glimpse of the cover of her book.*
*It looks like the same book that she lent to me...*
*More than that, she seems to be on the first few pages.*
Yuri: "Ah..."
*Crap--*
*I think she noticed me looking at her...*
*She sneaks another glance at me, and our eyes meet for a split second.*
*But that only makes her hide her face deeper in her book.*
<USER>: "Sorry..."
<USER>: "I was just spacing out..."
*I mutter this, sensing I made her uncomfortable.*
Yuri: "It's fine..."
Yuri: "But I'm just re-reading a bit of this, so..."
<USER>: "That's the book that you gave me, right?"
Yuri: "Mhm."
Yuri: "I wanted to re-read some of it."
<USER>: "Just curious, how come you have two copies of the same book?"
Yuri: "Ah..."
Yuri: "Well, when I stopped at the bookstore yesterday--"
Yuri: "I mean--"
<USER>: "Ah, I see."
*There's something fairly obvious here that Yuri isn't telling me, but I decide to let it go.*
<USER>: "I'll definitely start reading it soon!"
Yuri: "Once it starts to pick up, you might have a hard time putting it down."
<USER>: "Is that so...?"
<USER>: "What's it about, anyway?"
Yuri: "Mmm..."
*Yuri closes the book and scans her eyes over the back.*
*The book is titled \*Portrait of Markov\*.*
*There's an ominous-looking eye symbol on the front cover.*
Yuri: "I just wanted to make sure I don't accidentally give anything away."
Yuri: "Basically, it's about this girl in high school who moves in with her long-lost younger sister..."
Yuri: "But as soon as she does so, her life gets really strange."
Yuri: "And while her life is in danger, she needs to desperately choose who to trust."
<USER>: "That's kind of--!"
*That's kind of dark, isn't it?*
*Yuri made it sound like it was going to be a nice story, so that dark turn came from nowhere.*
*Yuri gently giggles, all of a sudden.*
Yuri: "Are you not a fan of that sort of thing, <USER>?"
<USER>: "No, it's not that..."
<USER>: "I mean, I can definitely enjoy those kinds of stories, so don't worry."
*Yeah... I totally forgot that Yuri is into those things.*
*She's so shy and reclusive on the outside, but her mind seems to be completely different.*
Yuri: "It's just that those kinds of stories..."
Yuri: "When horrible things happen not just because someone wants to be evil..."
Yuri: "Then suddenly, when you thought you related to the protagonist..."
Yuri: "They're made out to be the naive one for letting their one-sided morals interfere with the villain's plans."
Yuri: "Not again..."
<USER>: "Hey, don't apologize...!"
<USER>: "I haven't lost interest or anything."
Yuri: "Well..."
Yuri: "I guess it's alright, then..."
Yuri: "When I let things like books and writing fill my thoughts..."
Yuri: "I kind of forget to pay attention to other people..."
Yuri: "And please stop me if I start talking too much!"
<USER>: "That's--"
<USER>: "I really don't think you need to worry..."
<USER>: "That just means you're passionate about reading."
<USER>: "The least I can do is listen."
<USER>: "It's a literature club, after all..."
Yuri: "That's..."
Yuri: "Well, that's true..."
<USER>: "In fact..."
<USER>: "I might as well get started reading it, right?"
<USER>: "Ahaha, what are you saying?"
<USER>: "Just a moment ago, you said you were looking forward to it."
<USER>: "Let me just get the book..."
*I quickly retrieve the book that I had put into my bag.*
<USER>: "Alright...it's fine if I sit here, right?"
*I slip into the seat next to Yuri's.*
Yuri: "Yeah..."
<USER>: "Are you sure?"
<USER>: "<USER> seem a little apprehensive..."
Yuri: "That's..."
Yuri: "It's not that I don't want you to!"
Yuri: "It's just something I'm not very used to..."
Yuri: "That is, reading in company with someone."
<USER>: "I see..."
<USER>: "Well, just tell me if I end up distracting you or anything."
Yuri: "A-Alright..."
*I open the book and start the prologue.*
*I soon understand what Yuri means about reading in company.*
*It's as if I can feel her presence over my shoulder as I read.*
*It's not a particularly bad thing.*
*Maybe a little distracting, but the feeling is somewhat comforting.*
*Yuri is in the corner of my eye.*
*I realize that she's not actually looking at her own book.*
*I glance over.*
*It looks like she's reading from my book instead--*
Yuri: "S-Sorry!"
Yuri: "I was just--!"
<USER>: "Yuri, you really apologize a lot, don't you?"
Yuri: "I...I do?"
Yuri: "Sorry..."
<USER>: "Ahaha."
<USER>: "Here, this should work, right?"
*I slide my desk until it's up against Yuri's, then hold my book more between the two of them.*
Yuri: "I suppose so..."
*Yuri timidly closes her own copy.*
*Once we each lean in a little bit, our shoulders are almost touching.*
*It feels like my left arm is in the way, so instead I use my right hand to hold the book open.*
<USER>: "Ah, I guess that makes it kind of difficult to turn the page..."
Yuri: "Here..."
*Yuri takes her left arm and holds the left side of the book between her thumb and forefinger.*
<USER>: "Ah..."
*I do the same with my right arm, on the right side of the book.*
*That way, I turn a page, and Yuri slides it under her thumb after it flips to her side.*
*But in holding it like this...*
*We're huddled even closer together than before.*
*It's actually kind of distracting me...!*
*It's as if I can feel the warmth of Yuri's face, and she's in the corner of my vision...*
Yuri: "...Are you ready?"
<USER>: "Eh?"
Yuri: "To turn the page..."
<USER>: "Ah...sorry!"
<USER>: "I think I got a bit distracted for a second..."
*I glance over at Yuri's face again, and our eyes meet.*
*I don't know how I'll be able to keep up with her...*
Yuri: "Ah..."
Yuri: "That's okay."
Yuri: "You're not as used to reading, right?"
Yuri: "I don't mind being patient if it takes you a bit longer..."
Yuri: "It's probably the least I can do..."
Yuri: "Since you've been so patient with me..."
<USER>: "Y-Yeah..."
<USER>: "Thanks."
*We continue reading.*
*Yuri no longer asks me if I'm ready to turn the page.*
*Instead, I just assume that she finishes the page before me, so I turn it by my own volition.*
*We continue the first chapter in silence.*
*Even so, turning each page almost feels like an intimate exchange...*
*My thumb gently letting go of the page, letting it flutter over to her side as she catches it under her own thumb.*
<USER>: "Hey, Yuri..."
<USER>: "This might be a silly thought, but..."
<USER>: "The main character kind of reminds me of you a little bit."
Yuri: "You...think so?"
Yuri: "How does she?"
<USER>: "Well, I guess she's more blunt in a lot of ways..."
<USER>: "But she also second-guesses all of the things that she says and does."
<USER>: "Like she's afraid she'll do something wrong."
<USER>: "It's not like I can see into your head or anything..."
<USER>: "But they're kind of reminiscent of some of your mannerisms."
Yuri: "I-I see..."
*Yuri remains silent for a moment.*
Yuri: "But <USER>..."
Yuri: "That's probably..."
Yuri: "...a terrible thing to have in common with her!"
<USER>: "W-Wait!"
<USER>: "I didn't mean it in a bad way or anything!"
<USER>: "Sorry, I really didn't know you were self-conscious about that sort of thing..."
Yuri: "..."
<USER>: "I guess I more meant that it's kind of cute..."
Yuri: "What are you saying all of a sudden...?"
Yuri: "I...!"
Monika: "Okay, everyone!"
Yuri: "...!"
Monika: "I think it's about time we share today's poems with each other."
Monika: "We might not have enough time if we wait too long."
*Yuri exhales, spared from finishing her thought.*
Monika: "You look kind of down..."
Monika: "I'm sorry if you haven't been looking forward to this..."
Yuri: "...It's fine."
*Yuri releases her hand from the book, causing it to close on top of my thumb.*
<USER>: "Alright..."
<USER>: "I guess I'll do some more reading tonight."
<USER>: "Or would you prefer I only read it with you?"
Yuri: "I...guess I don't have too much of a preference either way..."
<USER>: "Hmm..."
<USER>: "In that case, I'll read a little more tonight."
<USER>: "It'll be more fun to read with you after it picks up a bit, you know?"
Yuri: "In that case, feel free to finish the first two chapters in your own time."
<USER>: "Alright!"
*I stand up.*
*I make a mental note of where I left off in the book, then slip it back into my bag.*
<USER>: "Hey, Yuri."
Yuri: "Eh?"
<USER>: "Ah..."
*I suddenly notice that Yuri is reading a different book from the one we've been reading together.*
<USER>: "Sorry! I didn't mean to interrupt..."
Yuri: "I was kind of just waiting for you..."
<USER>: "Ah, if that's the case..."
<USER>: "Why don't we go ahead and get started?"
Yuri: "...Do you mind if I make some tea first?"
<USER>: "Not at all."
Yuri: "Not to mention for yourself, as well."
*Yuri stands up and makes her way to the closet.*
*I follow and watch as she retrieves a small water pitcher from the shelf - the kind with a filter inside.*
Yuri: "Can you hold this for a second?"
<USER>: "Sure..."
*Yuri hands me the water pitcher and also fetches an electric kettle.*
Yuri: "I'm going to plug this in at the teacher's desk, and then we'll go get some water."
*She walks past me and sets the kettle down on the teacher's desk.*
*I simply watch her movements.*
*To my surprise, the way she moves really contrasts her speaking mannerisms.*
*Especially because of her long legs, Yuri appears elegant and methodical.*
Yuri: "Okay, may I have the water pitcher?"
<USER>: "Ah, I might as well walk with you..."
Yuri: "Shall we go, then?"
<USER>: "Yeah..."
Monika: "Hm? Where are you two off to?"
<USER>: "Eh?"
<USER>: "We're just...Yuri was going to make some tea, so..."
*I suddenly realize how weird it sounds to explain this to Monika.*
<USER>: "We're just filling the water pitcher..."
Monika: "Ah, okay!"
Monika: "That's kind of a one-person job, isn't it?"
<USER>: "That's--"
Yuri: "Or do you want to tell me there's something wrong with helping involve <USER> in club activities?"
<USER>: "--!"
*My mouth gapes.*
Monika: "I suppose there's nothing wrong with that..."
Yuri: "Then let's go, <USER>."
<USER>: "Ah..."
*Yuri quickly exits the room, and I follow.*
*Once in the hallway, she suddenly puts her forehead against the wall.*
Yuri: "I spoke without thinking..."
Yuri: "How could I say something like that...?"
<USER>: "Yuri..."
Yuri: "Something about the way she said that..."
Yuri: "It made me feel so...irritated."
Yuri: "What's wrong with me...?"
<USER>: "No, Yuri."
<USER>: "I think...you did the right thing!"
<USER>: "I wasn't expecting it, but..."
<USER>: "It's also not right for Monika to judge people like that."
Yuri: "How come even when I do something bad..."
Yuri: "You're being nice to me?"
<USER>: "Because."
<USER>: "Nothing that you do is as bad as you make it seem in your head."
<USER>: "Nobody's perfect."
<USER>: "We have emotions, and we can't always hide them away."
<USER>: "But you always amplify things in your head..."
<USER>: "<USER>r mind turns a light rain shower into a hurricane."
Yuri: "N-No..."
Yuri: "Wouldn't you hate me for something as terrible as that...?"
<USER>: "Why would I hate you?"
<USER>: "I can't hate someone for having emotions..."
<USER>: "What kind of friend would do that?"
Yuri: "Ah...um..."
*Yuri lifts her head.*
<USER>: "Ahaha..."
<USER>: "Thanks, Yuri."
<USER>: "I like being friends with you too..."
*I feel kind of awkward saying something like that...*
*But I'm doing my best to help Yuri feel better.*
<USER>: "Anyway...!"
Yuri: "Shall we go?"
<USER>: "Yeah."
*Yuri and I walk to the nearest water fountain.*
*Once we fill up the water pitcher, we return to the classroom.*
Yuri: "<USER>, do you like oolong tea?"
<USER>: "Ah, yeah."
<USER>: "Anything is fine."
Yuri: "Very well."
*Yuri sets the temperature on the kettle to 200 degrees.*
<USER>: "<USER> really do this properly, don't you?"
Yuri: "I shouldn't do any less when I'm making tea for others."
<USER>: "Even if I'm not an expert on tea or anything...?"
<USER>: "Ah...perhaps I will!"
*Yuri fetches the teapot and begins measuring the tea leaves.*
*To my surprise, she even starts humming a little to herself.*
<USER>: "<USER> must be in a good mood now..."
Yuri: "I was letting it show..."
Yuri: "And you noticed."
Yuri: "And I decided that I would try expressing myself a little bit more."
Yuri: "It turns out it's not very hard for me to do..."
<USER>: "Ah..."
<USER>: "That's great, Yuri!"
<USER>: "Just don't push yourself too much."
Yuri: "It's very endearing."
<USER>: "That's..."
*Yuri wasn't kidding...*
*I don't even know if I can keep up with this...!*
*I watch Yuri pour a cup of tea for each of us.*
Yuri: "Do you mind if we sit on the floor today?"
<USER>: "Eh? Why's that?"
Yuri: "I can read with my back against the wall rather than bending over at my desk."
<USER>: "Ah, sorry, I didn't realize."
Yuri: "I just have back pain fairly regularly, so I do my best to manage it."
<USER>: "Is that so?"
<USER>: "I wonder why that is..."
<USER>: "<USER>r posture, right?"
<USER>: "Always hunched over like that while reading..."
Yuri: "So that's why we should sit on the floor."
<USER>: "Fair enough."
<USER>: "I'll go ahead and get the book."
*I retrieve the book from my bag.*
<USER>: "Ah, I have some chocolate as well..."
*It's a bag of small chocolate candies that I kept hidden from Sayori's candy radar.*
*I take it, since it'll go well with the tea.*
*Yuri and I then sit against the wall, teacups at our sides.*
*As if in sync, we assume the same reading position as last time, each holding one half of the book.*
*Except this time...*
*Our bodies are even closer to each other.*
Yuri: "I can't see too well..."
<USER>: "--!"
*Yuri slides closer until our shoulders are touching.*
*How am I supposed to focus on reading like this...?!*
*Yuri was always kind of cute, but...*
*When she's being less apprehensive, it's almost more than I can handle!*
*Yuri hands me my teacup.*
*Holding it with my hand that's not holding the book, I end up in a position that makes it even harder to focus.*
*Because now I need to worry about making sure I don't accidentally touch her chest...!*
*Meanwhile, Yuri hasn't noticed a single thing.*
*She wears her intense reading expression, and I can only presume the world around her has faded away.*
*I use all of my willpower to focus on reading.*
*...*
*After a few minutes, I finally manage to relax a little.*
*I put the teacup between my legs and fumble with the chocolate wrapper.*
<USER>: "Ah, sorry..."
*I briefly let go of the book to finish opening the wrapper.*
<USER>: "<USER> can have as much as you want."
Yuri: "That's okay, I won't take any..."
<USER>: "Eh? Are you sure?"
Yuri: "If I touch it, then it might get smudges on the pages..."
<USER>: "Ah, you're right..."
<USER>: "I didn't even think about that."
<USER>: "My bad..."
Yuri: "I'll hold the book, okay?"
<USER>: "Are you sure...?"
Yuri: "Of course."
*Yuri opens the book with both hands.*
*She holds it so that I don't have any harder of a time reading from it.*
*But as a result, her left arm is practically resting on top of my leg.*
<USER>: "Well, in that case..."
*Yuri is already totally focused on reading again.*
*I take a chocolate candy and pop it into my mouth.*
*Then, I take another chocolate...*
*And I hold it up to Yuri.*
*She doesn't even look away from the book.*
*She simply parts her lips, as if this situation was completely natural.*
*But that means I can't stop here!*
*I apprehensively place the chocolate in her mouth.*
*Just like that, Yuri closes her lips over it.*
Yuri: "Eh...?"
*Yuri's expression suddenly breaks.*
Yuri: "Did..."
Yuri: "Did I just..."
*Yuri looks at me like she needs to confirm what just happened.*
Yuri: "U-Um..."
Yuri: "<USER>..."
<USER>: "S-Sorry!"
<USER>: "I guess I shouldn't have done that..."
Yuri: "Ah, that's..."
Yuri: "Well..."
Yuri: "Y-You were just helping..."
Yuri: "That's something that...friends do..."
Yuri: "...Right?"
<USER>: "I mean..."
*Not really in this kind of context, but...*
<USER>: "Yeah..."
<USER>: "...That's all it was."
Yuri: "Yeah..."
Yuri: "Then..."
Yuri: "You don't need to stop or anything..."
<USER>: "I-I see..."
*The situation has gotten really tense...*
*Yuri tries to return to the book.*
*But I can tell just by her expression that even she can't focus now.*
*My heart is pounding...*
*I nervously take another chocolate between my fingers.*
*But this time, Yuri's eyes meet mine.*
Yuri: "..."
*How did it even come to this...?*
*Yuri doesn't avert her gaze.*
*I notice her chest rising and falling to the rhythm of her breaths.*
*I raise my arm...*
Yuri: "Ah..."
*Like before, Yuri parts her lips.*
*But...it's different this time.*
*I take the chocolate and place it in her mouth.*
*I feel her hot breath on my fingers.*
Monika: "Okay, everyone!"
<USER>: "Uwa--"
Yuri: "A-Ah!"
*Yuri jolts back.*
Monika: "It's time to share poems!"
Monika: "<USER>, you can help Yuri put away the tea stuff, right?"
<USER>: "Y-Yeah...of course."
Monika: "Okay, thanks!"
*The spell is abruptly broken.*
Yuri: "I'll take care of the cups..."
<USER>: "Yeah..."
*Yuri picks up the teacups from the floor.*
*I pick up the bag of chocolates.*
*In the end, we hastily clean up without so much as a word between us.*
*I get the feeling this is something neither of us will have the courage to bring up...*
Natsuki: "Ugh...!"
*I hear Natsuki utter an exasperated sigh from within the closet.*
*She seems to be annoyed by something.*
*I approach her, in case she needs a hand.*
<USER>: "<USER> looking for something in there?"
Natsuki: "She never puts my stuff back in the right spot!"
Natsuki: "What's the point in keeping your collection organized if someone else is just gonna mess it up?"
*Natsuki slides a bunch of stacked books and boxes across the shelf.*
<USER>: "Manga..."
<USER>: "Ah--"
<USER>: "...Sometimes..."
*Manga is one of those things where you can't admit you're really into it until you figure out where the other person stands.*
<USER>: "...How did you know, anyway?"
Natsuki: "Besides, it's kind of written on your face."
*What's that supposed to mean...?*
<USER>: "I-I see..."
*There's a lone volume of manga amidst a stack of various books on the side of one of the shelves.*
*Curious, I pull it out of the stack.*
*Natsuki snatches it out of my hand.*
*She then turns to a box of manga and slips the volume right into the middle of the rest.*
Natsuki: "Seeing a box set with one book missing is probably the most irritating sight in the world."
<USER>: "I know that feel..."
*I get a closer look at the box set she's admiring.*
<USER>: "Parfait Girls...?"
*It's a series I've never heard of in my life.*
*That probably means it's either way out of my demographic, or it's simply terrible.*
*She points to the classroom door.*
<USER>: "H-Hey, I wasn't judging anything...!"
<USER>: "I didn't even say anything."
Natsuki: "But I'll tell you one thing, <USER>."
Natsuki: "don't judge a bookkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk kkkkk kk{space=20}k{space=40}k{space=120}k{space=160}k{space=200}k"
Natsuki: "In fact--"
*Natsuki pulls out the first volume of Parfait Girls from the box.*
Natsuki: "I'm gonna show you exactly why!"
*She shoves the book right into my hands.*
<USER>: "Ah..."
*I stare at the cover.*
*It features four girls in colorful attire striking animated feminine poses.*
*It's...exceedingly \*moe\*.*
<USER>: "Uwa--"
*Natsuki grabs my arm and pulls me out of the closet.*
*She then takes a seat against the wall, beneath the windowsills.*
*She pats on the ground next to her, signaling me to sit there.*
<USER>: "Wouldn't chairs be more comfortable...?"
*I take my seat.*
Natsuki: "We can't read at the same time like that."
<USER>: "Eh? Why's that?"
<USER>: "Ah...I guess it's easier to be close together like this..."
Natsuki: "You'll make me feel weird about it!"
*Natsuki crosses her arms and scootches an inch away from me.*
<USER>: "Sorry..."
*I didn't exactly expect to be sitting this close to her, either...*
*Not that I can say it's a particularly bad thing.*
*I open the book.*
*It's only a few seconds before Natsuki once again inches closer, reclaiming the additional space while she hopes I won't notice.*
*I can feel her peering over my shoulder, much more eager to begin reading than I am.*
<USER>: "Hm?"
<USER>: "<USER> don't go back and flip through the older volumes every now and then?"
Natsuki: "Maybe sometimes after I've already finished the series."
<USER>: "Uh..."
*I am, but nothing's really happened yet, so I can talk at the same time.*
*It looks like it's about a bunch of friends in high school.*
*Typical slice-of-life affair.*
*I kind of grew out of these, since it's rare for the writing to be entertaining enough to make up for the lack of plot.*
<USER>: "...Are you sure this isn't boring for you?"
Natsuki: "It's not!"
<USER>: "Even though you're just watching me read?"
Natsuki: "Well...!"
Natsuki: "I'm...fine with that."
<USER>: "If you say so..."
<USER>: "...I guess it's fun sharing something you like with someone else."
<USER>: "I always get excited when I convince any of my friends to pick up a series I enjoy."
<USER>: "<USER> know what I mean?"
Natsuki: "...?"
<USER>: "Hm?"
<USER>: "<USER> don't?"
Natsuki: "Um..."
Natsuki: "That's not..."
Natsuki: "Well, I wouldn't really know."
<USER>: "...What do you mean?"
<USER>: "Don't you share your manga with your friends?"
Natsuki: "Could you not rub it in?"
Natsuki: "Jeez..."
<USER>: "Ah... Sorry..."
Natsuki: "Hmph."
Natsuki: "Like I could ever get my friends to read this..."
Natsuki: "They just think manga is for kids."
Natsuki: "I can't even bring it up without them being all like..."
Natsuki: "'Eh? You still haven't grown out of that yet?'"
Natsuki: "Makes me want to punch them in the face..."
<USER>: "Urgh, I know those kinds of people..."
<USER>: "Honestly, it takes a lot of effort to find friends who don't judge, much less friends who are also into it..."
<USER>: "I'm already kind of a loser, so I guess I gravitated toward the other losers over time."
<USER>: "But it's probably harder for someone like you..."
Natsuki: "Hm."
Natsuki: "Yeah, that's pretty accurate."
*{i}...Wait, which part??{/i}*
Natsuki: "I mean, I feel like I can't even keep it in my own room..."
Natsuki: "My dad would beat the shit out of me if he found this."
Natsuki: "At least it's safe here in the clubroom."
Natsuki: "'Cept Monika's kind of a jerk about it..."
Natsuki: "Ugh! I just can't win, can I?"
<USER>: "Well, it paid off in the end, didn't it?"
<USER>: "I mean, here I am, reading it."
Natsuki: "Well, it's not like that solves any of my problems."
<USER>: "Maybe..."
<USER>: "But at least you're enjoying yourself, right?"
Natsuki: "--"
Natsuki: "..."
Natsuki: "...So?"
<USER>: "Ahaha."
Natsuki: "Jeez, that's enough!"
Natsuki: "Are you gonna keep reading, or what?"
<USER>: "Yeah, yeah..."
*I flip the page.*
*...*
*...*
*.....*
*.......*
*.........*
*Time passes.*
*Natsuki is strangely quiet now.*
*I glance over at her.*
*It looks like she's started to fall asleep.*
<USER>: "Hey, Natsuki..."
Natsuki: "Y-Yeah...?"
*Suddenly, Natsuki collapses straight into me.*
<USER>: "H-Hey--"
Natsuki: "{color=#000}[ntext]{/color}"
Natsuki: "{color=#000}[ntext]{/color}"
Monika: "Oh jeez..."
Natsuki: "..."
*Monika reaches into her bag and pulls out some kind of protein bar.*
*She throws it in Natsuki's direction.*
*Natsuki's eyes suddenly light up again.*
*She snatches the bar from the floor and immediately tears off the wrapper.*
*She doesn't even finish her sentence before stuffing it into her mouth.*
Monika: "Don't worry, <USER>."
Monika: "She's fine."
Monika: "It just happens every now and then."
Monika: "Why don't we all share poems now?"
*I'm really curious to talk to Yuri a little bit more...*
*But at the same time, I would feel bad for distracting her from reading.*
*I catch a glimpse of the cover of her book.*
*It looks like the same book that she lent to me...*
*More than that, she seems to be on the first few pages.*
Yuri: "Ah..."
*Crap--*
*I think she noticed me looking at her...*
*She sneaks another glance at me, and our eyes meet for a split second.*
*But that only makes her hide her face deeper in her book.*
<USER>: "Sorry..."
<USER>: "I was just spacing out..."
*I mutter this, sensing I made her uncomfortable.*
Yuri: "It's fine..."
Yuri: "If I was focused, then I probably wouldn't have noticed in the first place."
Yuri: "But I'm just re-reading a bit of this, so..."
<USER>: "That's the book that you gave me, right?"
Yuri: "Mhm."
Yuri: "I wanted to re-read some of it."
<USER>: "Just curious, how come you have two copies of the same book?"
Yuri: "Ah..."
Yuri: "Well, when I stopped at the bookstore yesterday--"
Yuri: "I mean--"
<USER>: "Ah, I see."
*There's something fairly obvious here that Yuri isn't telling me, but I decide to let it go.*
<USER>: "I'll definitely start reading it soon!"
Yuri: "Once it starts to pick up, you might have a hard time putting it down."
<USER>: "Is that so...?"
<USER>: "What's the story about, anyway?"
Yuri: "Mmm..."
*I look at the cover of the book.*
*The book is titled \*Portrait of Markov\*.*
*There's an ominous-looking eye symbol on the front cover.*
Yuri: "And the people trapped there have this trait that turns them into killing machines that lust for blood."
<USER>: "That's kind of--!"
*That's kind of dark, isn't it?*
*Yuri made it sound like it was going to be a nice story, so that dark turn came from nowhere.*
Yuri: "Are you not a fan of that sort of thing, <USER>?"
<USER>: "No, it's not that..."
<USER>: "I mean, I can definitely enjoy those kinds of stories, so don't worry."
*Yeah... I totally forgot that Yuri is into those things.*
*She's so shy and reclusive on the outside, but her mind seems to be completely different.*
Yuri: "It's just that this kind of story..."
Yuri: "When horrible things happen not just because someone wants to be evil..."
Yuri: "But because the world is full of horrible people, and we're all worthless anyway."
Yuri: "Then, suddenlyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy{nw}"
Yuri: "Not again..."
<USER>: "Hey, don't apologize...!"
<USER>: "I haven't lost interest or anything."
Yuri: "Well..."
Yuri: "I guess it's alright, then..."
Yuri: "When I let things like books and writing fill my thoughts..."
Yuri: "my whole body gets incredibly [gtext]{nw}"
Yuri: "I kind of forget to pay attention to other people..."
Yuri: "And please stop me if I start talking too much!"
<USER>: "That's--"
<USER>: "I really don't think you need to worry..."
<USER>: "That just means you're passionate about reading."
<USER>: "The least I can do is listen."
<USER>: "It's a literature club, after all..."
Yuri: "That's..."
Yuri: "Well, that's true..."
<USER>: "In fact..."
<USER>: "I might as well get started reading it, right?"
<USER>: "Ahaha, what are you saying?"
<USER>: "Let me just get the book..."
*I quickly retrieve the book that I had put into my bag.*
<USER>: "Alright...it's fine if I sit here, right?"
*I slip into the seat next to Yuri's.*
Yuri: "Yeah..."
<USER>: "Are you sure?"
<USER>: "<USER> seem a little apprehensive..."
Yuri: "That's..."
Yuri: "It's not that I don't want you to!"
Yuri: "It's just something I'm not very used to..."
Yuri: "That is, reading in company with someone."
<USER>: "I see..."
<USER>: "Well, just tell me if I end up distracting you or anything."
Yuri: "A-Alright..."
*I open the book and start the prologue.*
*I soon understand what Yuri means about reading in company.*
*It's as if I can feel her presence over my shoulder as I read.*
*It's not a particularly bad thing.*
*Maybe a little distracting, but the feeling is somewhat comforting.*
*Yuri is in the corner of my eye.*
*I realize that she's not actually looking at her own book.*
*I glance over.*
*It looks like she's reading from my book instead--*
Yuri: "S-Sorry!"
Yuri: "I was just--!{nw}"
Yuri: "I was just{fast} bathing in the feeling of your body heat tttttttttttttheat eattttttt{nw}"
<USER>: "Yuri, you really apologize a lot, don't you?"
Yuri: "I...I do?"
Yuri: "Sorry..."
<USER>: "Ahaha."
<USER>: "Here, this should work, right?"
*I slide my desk until it's up against Yuri's, then hold my book more between the two of them.*
Yuri: "I-I suppose so..."
*Yuri timidly closes her own copy.*
*Once we each lean in a little bit, our shoulders are almost touching.*
*It feels like my left arm is in the way, so instead I use my right hand to hold the book open.*
<USER>: "Ah, I guess that makes it kind of difficult to turn the page..."
Yuri: "Here..."
*Yuri takes her left arm and holds the left side of the book between her thumb and forefinger.*
<USER>: "Ah..."
*I do the same with my right arm, on the right side of the book.*
*That way, I turn a page, and Yuri slides it under her thumb after it flips to her side.*
*But in holding it like this...*
*We're huddled even closer together than before.*
*It's actually kind of distracting me...!*
*It's as if I can feel the warmth of Yuri's face, and she's in the corner of my vision...*
Yuri: "...Are you ready?"
<USER>: "Eh?"
Yuri: "To turn the page..."
<USER>: "Ah...sorry!"
<USER>: "I think I got a bit distracted for a second..."
*I glance over at Yuri's face again, and our eyes meet.*
*I don't know how I'll be able to keep up with her...*
Yuri: "Ah..."
Yuri: "That's okay."
Yuri: "You're not as used to reading, right?"
Yuri: "I don't mind being patient if it takes you a bit longer..."
Yuri: "It's probably the least I can do..."
Yuri: "Since you've been so patient with me..."
<USER>: "Y-Yeah..."
<USER>: "Thanks."
*We continue reading.*
*Yuri no longer asks me if I'm ready to turn the page.*
*Instead, I just assume that she finishes the page before me, so I turn it by my own volition.*
*We continue the first chapter in silence.*
*Even so, turning each page almost feels like an intimate exchange...*
*My thumb gently letting go of the page, letting it flutter over to her side as she catches it under her own thumb.*
<USER>: "Hey, Yuri..."
<USER>: "This might be a silly thought, but..."
<USER>: "The main character kind of reminds me of you a little bit."
Yuri: "E-Eh??"
Yuri: "N-No, I don't relate to this character at all!"
Yuri: "Definitely not!"
<USER>: "Really...?"
<USER>: "I was just thinking the way she second-guesses things she says, and all that..."
Yuri: "A-Ah..."
Yuri: "That's what you were talking about..."
Yuri: "Sorry..."
Yuri: "I thought you meant...something else about her."
<USER>: "Something else...?"
Yuri: "N-Never mind!"
Yuri: "We didn't even get that far yet..."
Yuri: "So I don't know why that came into my head..."
Yuri: "Ahaha!"
<USER>: "Yuri, are you feeling alright?"
Yuri: "Eh--?"
*Yuri's been a little fidgety ever since we started reading...*
<USER>: "<USER> can rest if you're feeling sick or something."
<USER>: "<USER>r breathing is a little..."
Yuri: "My breathing...?"
*Yuri puts her hands on her chest, as if to feel her heartbeat.*
Yuri: "I-I didn't...even notice..."
Yuri: "...Anyway, I'm fine!"
Yuri: "I just need some water...!"
<USER>: "Alright...don't push yourself."
*Yuri stands up and practically rushes out of the classroom.*
<USER>: "What on Earth was that about...?"
Monika: "<USER>?"
Monika: "Did something happen just now?"
<USER>: "Eh?"
<USER>: "I have no idea..."
<USER>: "Yuri was acting a little strange, I guess..."
<USER>: "Sorry, I can't say I do."
<USER>: "Are you worried about her?"
Monika: "I was just making sure that you didn't do anything to her."
<USER>: "N-No, nothing!"
Monika: "Yuri just does this sometimes, so it's nothing alarming."
<USER>: "Alright...if you say so."
<USER>: "Eh?"
<USER>: "Shouldn't we wait for Yuri?"
Monika: "Is that okay?"
<USER>: "Yeah, I was just asking..."
*I stand up.*
*I make a mental note of where I left off in the book, then slip it back into my bag.*
<USER>: "Hey, Yuri."
Yuri: "Eh?"
<USER>: "Ah..."
*I suddenly notice that Yuri is reading a different book from the one we've been reading together.*
<USER>: "Sorry! I didn't mean to interrupt..."
Yuri: "I was kind of just waiting for you..."
<USER>: "Ah, if that's the case..."
<USER>: "Why don't we go ahead and get started?"
Yuri: "...Do you mind if I make some tea first?"
<USER>: "Not at all."
Yuri: "Not to mention for yourself, as well."
*Yuri stands up and makes her way to the closet.*
*I follow and watch as she retrieves a small water pitcher from the shelf - the kind with a filter inside.*
Yuri: "Can you hold this for a second?"
<USER>: "Sure..."
*Yuri hands me the water pitcher and also fetches an electric kettle.*
Yuri: "I'm going to plug this in at the teacher's desk, and then I'll go get some water."
*She walks past me and sets the kettle down on the teacher's desk.*
*I simply watch her movements.*
*To my surprise, the way she moves really contrasts her speaking mannerisms.*
*Especially because of her long legs, Yuri appears elegant and methodical.*
Yuri: "Okay, may I have the water pitcher?"
<USER>: "Ah, I might as well walk with you..."
Yuri: "You stay here..."
Yuri: "It won't take long."
*Pitcher in hand, Yuri hurries out of the classroom.*
Monika: "Ah..."
Monika: "Did Yuri leave you again?"
<USER>: "No, it's not like that this time."
<USER>: "She's just filling up the water pitcher to make tea."
Monika: "Sorry for misunderstanding~"
*...*
*Ten minutes pass.*
*Yuri said it wouldn't take long...*
*Is something holding her up?*
*I'm bored just waiting here, so I decide to go look for her.*
<USER>: "Let's see..."
*The most logical place for Yuri to be would be the nearest water fountain...*
*I start heading down the hallway.*
Yuri: "Haah.....haah...."
Yuri: "....Haah.....haah...."
*...What's that noise?*
*It's coming from around the corner...*
*It sounds like breathing.*
Yuri: "Khhhhh--"
*A sharp inhale, like someone is sucking the air through their teeth.*
*Are they in pain...?*
*I reach the corner and peer around it.*
<USER>: "Yuri...?"
Yuri: "Kya--!"
<USER>: "{cps=150}Yuri...?{/cps}{nw}"

*{cps=150}Yuri said it wouldn't take long...{/cps}{nw}*
*{cps=150}Ten minutes pass.{/cps}{nw}*
*{cps=150}...{/cps}{nw}*
Yuri: "I'm back."
Yuri: "Thanks for waiting patiently."
Yuri: "<USER>, do you like oolong tea?"
<USER>: "Ah, yeah."
<USER>: "Anything is fine."
Yuri: "Very well."
*Yuri sets the temperature on the kettle to 200 degrees.*
<USER>: "<USER> really do this properly, don't you?"
Yuri: "I shouldn't do any less when I'm making tea for others."
<USER>: "Even if I'm not an expert on tea or anything...?"
<USER>: "Ah...perhaps I will!"
*Yuri fetches the teapot and begins measuring the tea leaves.*
*To my surprise, she even starts humming a little to herself.*
<USER>: "<USER> must be in a good mood now..."
Yuri: "I was letting it show..."
Yuri: "And you noticed."
Yuri: "And I decided that I would try expressing myself a little bit more."
Yuri: "It turns out it's not very hard for me to do..."
<USER>: "Ah..."
<USER>: "That's great, Yuri!"
<USER>: "Just don't push yourself too much."
Yuri: "It's very endearing."
<USER>: "That's..."
*Yuri wasn't kidding...*
*I don't even know if I can keep up with this...!*
*I watch Yuri pour a cup of tea for each of us.*
Yuri: "Do you mind if we sit on the floor today?"
<USER>: "Eh? Why's that?"
Yuri: "I can read with my back against the wall rather than bending over at my desk."
<USER>: "Ah, sorry, I didn't realize."
Yuri: "I just have back pain fairly regularly, so I do my best to manage it."
<USER>: "Is that so?"
<USER>: "I wonder why that is..."
<USER>: "<USER>r posture, right?"
<USER>: "Always hunched over like that while reading..."
Yuri: "So that's why we should sit on the floor."
<USER>: "Fair enough."
<USER>: "I'll go ahead and get the book."
*I retrieve the book from my bag.*
<USER>: "Ah, I have some chocolate as well..."
*It's a bag of small chocolate candies.*
*I take it, since it'll go well with the tea.*
*Yuri and I then sit against the wall, teacups at our sides.*
*As if in sync, we assume the same reading position as last time, each holding one half of the book.*
*Except this time...*
*Our bodies are even closer to each other.*
Yuri: "I can't see too well..."
<USER>: "--!"
*Yuri slides closer until our shoulders are touching.*
*How am I supposed to focus on reading like this...?!*
*Yuri was always kind of cute, but...*
*When she's being less apprehensive, it's almost more than I can handle!*
*Yuri hands me my teacup.*
*Holding it with my hand that's not holding the book, I end up in a position that makes it even harder to focus.*
*Because now I need to worry about making sure I don't accidentally touch her chest...!*
*Meanwhile, Yuri hasn't noticed a single thing.*
*She wears her intense reading expression, and I can only presume the world around her has faded away.*
*I use all of my willpower to focus on reading.*
*...*
*After a few minutes, I finally manage to relax a little.*
*I put the teacup between my legs and fumble with the chocolate wrapper.*
<USER>: "Ah, sorry..."
*I briefly let go of the book to finish opening the wrapper.*
<USER>: "<USER> can have as much as you want."
Yuri: "That's okay, I won't take any..."
<USER>: "Eh? Are you sure?"
Yuri: "If I touch it, then it might get smudges on the pages..."
<USER>: "Ah, you're right..."
<USER>: "I didn't even think about that."
<USER>: "My bad..."
Yuri: "I'll hold the book, okay?"
<USER>: "Are you sure...?"
Yuri: "Of course."
*Yuri opens the book with both hands.*
*She holds it so that I don't have any harder of a time reading from it.*
*But as a result, her left arm is practically resting on top of my leg.*
<USER>: "Well, in that case..."
*Yuri is already totally focused on reading again.*
*I take a chocolate candy and pop it into my mouth.*
*Then, I take another chocolate...*
*And I hold it up to Yuri.*
*She doesn't even look away from the book.*
*She simply parts her lips, as if this situation was completely natural.*
*But that means I can't stop here!*
*I apprehensively place the chocolate in her mouth.*
*Just like that, Yuri closes her lips over it.*
Yuri: "Eh...?"
*Yuri's expression suddenly breaks.*
Yuri: "Did..."
Yuri: "Did I just..."
*Yuri looks at me like she needs to confirm what just happened.*
Yuri: "U-Um..."
Yuri: "<USER>..."
<USER>: "S-Sorry!"
<USER>: "I guess I shouldn't have done that..."
Yuri: "A-Ah..."
*Yuri starts to breathe heavily.*
Yuri: "I..."
Yuri: "I can't..."
Yuri: "<USER>..."
*Suddenly, Yuri forcefully grabs my arm and jerks me to my feet.*
*My teacup gets knocked over.*
Yuri: "<USER>..."
Yuri: "My heart..."
Yuri: "I can't calm down."
Yuri: "I can't focus on anything anymore...!"
Yuri: "Can you feel it, <USER>?"
*Yuri suddenly presses my hand against her chest.*
Yuri: "I feel like I'm losing my mind..."
Yuri: "I just want..."
Yuri: "...at you."
Yuri: "...Haah..."
Yuri: "...Haah..."
Yuri: "...Haah..."
Monika: "U-Um..."
Monika: "It's...time to share poems..."
Yuri: "{cps=70}[gtext]{nw}"
Yuri: "Um..."
Yuri: "Wait..."
Yuri: "This hasn't happened before or anything...right?"
Yuri: "I would hate for you to think I'm weird just after we started spending time together..."
Yuri: "I mean..."
Yuri: "Everyone has a few unusual things about them."
Yuri: "At least, that's what I've discovered."
Yuri: "When I was a bit younger, I think I would come on really strongly and get a little too intense..."
Yuri: "It made people not want to be around me."
Yuri: "My obsession with certain hobbies."
Yuri: "And the way I can't control myself when I get too excited about something."
Yuri: "So..."
Yuri: "If nobody could ever like me for the things that matter most to me..."
Yuri: "I don't know what it is."
Yuri: "Like it's going to rip out of my chest."
Yuri: "It overwhelms me with energy and emotions that I can't let out."
Yuri: "It's been making me do weird things."
Yuri: "Is it just me, or has Monika been acting a little off lately?"
Yuri: "But recently, I've been feeling something sharp whenever she's around."
Yuri: "I couldn't say anything before, because she's always listening!"
Yuri: "Can we just stay here for a while?"
Yuri: "..."
Yuri: "Just the two of us."
Yuri: "We can stay here until the club ends."
Yuri: "Nobody to interfere with our reading time."
Yuri: "That was a joke!"
Yuri: "Just a joke."
Yuri: "It sounds strange, but you wouldn't understand if you've never seen how beautiful they can be."
Yuri: "Why don't you come to my house sometime?"
Yuri: "I've gotten them all from various artisans."
Yuri: "Because we have each other."
Yuri: "Every day."
Yuri: "That's all we need."
Yuri: "Let's quit the Literature Club."
Yuri: "There's no need for us to be around Monika's slimy tongue anymore."
Yuri: "And read together."
Yuri: "Sleep together."
Yuri: "It's everything we could ever want."
Yuri: "It's almost like it was fate."
Yuri: "Fate that we would meet each other."
Yuri: "And now we get the happy ending that I've patiently waited years for."
Yuri: "Will you do that with me, <USER>?"
Yuri: "Will{space=60}[gtext]{nw}"

Yuri: "I...I'm sorry I have such terrible handwriting!"
<USER>: "What??"
<USER>: "I wasn't thinking that at all..."
<USER>: "Ah--"
<USER>: "Well, I just don't read script very often..."
<USER>: "I actually think your handwriting is pretty."
<USER>: "Also, I liked the poem."
<USER>: "Even though it's short, it was really descriptive."
Yuri: "I usually write longer poems..."
<USER>: "Not at all."
Yuri: "I'll be honest..."
Yuri: "Something easy to digest, I suppose."
<USER>: "Are you into ghosts, Yuri?"
Yuri: "Actually, the story isn't about a ghost at all, <USER>."
<USER>: "Really?"
<USER>: "I must have totally missed the point..."
Yuri: "But remember that poets often express their own thoughts, feelings, and experiences in their work."
Yuri: "In this case, perhaps the subject of the poem is only being symbolically compared to a ghost."
Yuri: "And soon to be left with nothing..."
<USER>: "...That's a lot more solemn, putting it that way."
<USER>: "I hadn't even thought of that..."
<USER>: "That's impressive."
Yuri: "I was a little more daring with this one than yesterday's..."
<USER>: "I can see that."
<USER>: "It's a lot more metaphorical..."
*I don't know if it's my fault, but I can't begin to imagine what this poem is about.*
Yuri: "It's a bit closer to my preferred writing style..."
Yuri: "Using the poem as a canvas to express vivid imagery, and conveying emotions through them."
<USER>: "Yeah, if I take it at face value, then I can't even figure out what it's supposed to mean..."
Yuri: "I think it's something that different people can relate to in their own way."
Yuri: "I wanted to express the way it feels for me to indulge in my more unusual hobbies..."
Yuri: "So, I sometimes enjoy writing about them."
Yuri: "...But I'm glad that you're a good listener."
Yuri: "Um..."
Yuri: "I'm aware that the beach is kind of an inane thing to write about."
Yuri: "But I did my best to take a metaphorical approach to it."
Yuri: "Knowing her, it's no surprise that she'd want to do something like that."
Yuri: "She probably just wants to show off."
Yuri: "I just went with her request."
Yuri: "But..."
Yuri: "It's good for me to calm my thoughts once in a while."
<USER>: "Yeah...I think I agree."
<USER>: "Thanks for sharing."
*Finishing the poem, I start to hand it back to Yuri.*
*But instead of taking it from me, she looks away.*
Yuri: "..."
Yuri: "Do you...dislike it?"
<USER>: "Ah--no, of course not."
<USER>: "I just...don't really know how I should respond."
*Despite Yuri's poems usually being cryptic, it wasn't hard to figure out what this one was about.*
<USER>: "That's fine."
<USER>: "I understand this one."
*Yuri is having an even harder time speaking than usual.*
<USER>: "Does this one...mean a lot to you?"
*Yuri nods.*
<USER>: "I'm not really good with words, but..."
<USER>: "I'm happy that you shared it with me."
<USER>: "So, thank you."
<USER>: "And I hope we keep spending time together."
*Despite my inability to make eye contact, I see a faint smile emerge on Yuri's lips.*
*I once again try to hand the poem back to her.*
*But instead, Yuri gently takes my hands and pushes them back toward me.*
*I hesitate in response to her warm touch.*
Yuri: "Um..."
Yuri: "The poem is..."
*Once again, Yuri fails to form a complete sentence.*
<USER>: "<USER> mean I can keep it?"
*Yuri nods.*
<USER>: "I'd love to."
*Again, Yuri faintly smiles, as if she doesn't want me to notice.*
Yuri: "You always..."
Yuri: "You always...make me feel nice."
Yuri: "I know I'm not good with people, but..."
Yuri: "I hope that...I can return the favor sometimes."
<USER>: "Yeah."
<USER>: "Don't worry."
<USER>: "I think you do a good job."
*Yuri finally turns back toward me.*
Yuri: "But I'm sure we can talk again later..."
<USER>: "Yeah."
<USER>: "I'm sure we will."
*With that, Yuri timidly smiles at me, and I return to my seat so I can put her poem away.*
Natsuki: "I told you that you weren't gonna like it."
<USER>: "I like it."
Natsuki: "Just be honest!"
<USER>: "I am."
<USER>: "Why are you so convinced that I wouldn't like it?"
Natsuki: "Because!"
Natsuki: "Everyone in high school thinks that writing has to be all sophisticated and stuff..."
<USER>: "But isn't the point of poems for people to express themselves?"
<USER>: "<USER>r writing style wouldn't make your message any less valid."
Natsuki: "I like when it's easy to read, but it hits you hard."
Natsuki: "Seeing everyone around you do great things can be really disheartening..."
Natsuki: "So I decided to write about it."
<USER>: "Yeah, I understand."
Natsuki: "Like I set up for a rhyme at the end, but then made it fall flat on purpose."
Natsuki: "It helps bring out the feeling in the last line."
<USER>: "So you did..."
<USER>: "I guess more went into it than I realized."
Natsuki: "I'm glad you learned something."
Natsuki: "Didn't expect that from the youngest one here, did you?"
<USER>: "Yeah...guess not."
*I decide to humor her with that last comment.*
*I don't really care how old everyone is, but if Natsuki is feeling proud then I won't take that away from her.*
<USER>: "It's quite a bit longer than yesterday's."
Natsuki: "I was just warming up!"
<USER>: "No, of course not..."
Natsuki: "I doubt I have to explain it."
Natsuki: "And it helps people realize how stupid they're being."
<USER>: "Do you know people like that?"
Natsuki: "Everyone has some kind of weird hobby, or a guilty pleasure."
Natsuki: "Who cares what someone likes, as long as they're not hurting anyone, and it makes them happy?"
Natsuki: "I felt like I kept writing about negative things, so I wanted to write something with a nice message for once."
Natsuki: "Making us write about a simple topic, then trying to impress me by coming up with something all fancy."
Natsuki: "I just did it anyway."
Natsuki: "...But there's nothing wrong with doing that once in a while!"
Natsuki: "At the very least, it was good practice."
Natsuki: "...Why are you looking at me like that?"
Natsuki: "If you don't like it, then just say it."
<USER>: "No, it's not that I don't like it...!"
<USER>: "It was just...a little surprising to read."
<USER>: "Er...I guess I'm not used to hearing such nice things coming from you..."
Natsuki: "What do you think...the point of writing is?"
<USER>: "Yeah...I understand."
<USER>: "I'm sorry for missing the point sometimes."
<USER>: "I always mean well..."
<USER>: "And...I'm happy that you showed this to me."
<USER>: "I liked it."
*Natsuki mumbles, completely failing to sound confident like she usually does.*
Natsuki: "Just..."
Natsuki: "You know, when you're nice to me, it's..."
Natsuki: "...Meaningful."
<USER>: "Ah...I'm glad."
*Sensing Natsuki is satisfied, I start to hand the poem back to her.*
*But as I do so, Natsuki takes my hands and pushes them back away.*
*Her small, soft hands surprise me with their assertion.*
<USER>: "Eh...?"
<USER>: "Why not?"
Natsuki: "Jeez..."
*I realize what Natsuki is doing.*
*Unable to be honest, she's trying to give me the poem in a roundabout way.*
<USER>: "Well...in that case, I'm going to keep it."
*Instead of teasing her, I choose to go along with it.*
Natsuki: "If you didn't, I would..."
Natsuki: "..."
*Natsuki backpedals on her words and leaves it at that.*
*Despite her best efforts to hide her expression, I can see her faintly smiling to herself.*
Natsuki: "That's all for now, so..."
<USER>: "Ah...yeah."
<USER>: "I'll go do that."
*With that, I return to my seat so that I can put away Natsuki's poem.*
<USER>: "Sayori..."
<USER>: "This is just a guess, but..."
<USER>: "Did you wait until this morning to write this?"
<USER>: "<USER> can't answer 'just a little bit' to a yes or no question..."
<USER>: "Well, at least that makes me feel a little better about myself..."
Sayori: "I still tried my best..."
<USER>: "Ah, yeah..."
<USER>: "I didn't mean to say that it was a bad poem."
<USER>: "It came out nice...or, how should I put it..."
<USER>: "It sounds just like you."
<USER>: "Yeah."
<USER>: "Especially that last line..."
<USER>: "Even though you were late to school...?"
Sayori: "I get all cranky..."
<USER>: "Well, I guess there's no point in arguing..."
<USER>: "Anyway, thanks for showing me."
Sayori: "This was so much fun."
Sayori: "Monika's the best!"
<USER>: "Ah...yeah."
Sayori: "But next time, I won't forget."
<USER>: "Well, I guess I look forward to it."
<USER>: "Holy crap..."
<USER>: "Sayori, did you really write this?"
Sayori: "Didn't I tell you yesterday I was gonna write the best poem ever?"
<USER>: "Yeah, but..."
<USER>: "I mean, I didn't expect something like this, coming from you."
Sayori: "And I've been really in touch with my feelings recently..."
<USER>: "I see that..."
<USER>: "It's almost kind of creepy."
<USER>: "Well, not exactly..."
<USER>: "Maybe because I'm so used to you being cheerful..."
<USER>: "...Well, never mind."
<USER>: "I'm thinking too hard about it."
<USER>: "The point is, it came out good, so you should be proud of it."
Sayori: "I feel like..."
Sayori: "I feel like I was meant to express myself this way."
Sayori: "It even helps me understand my own feelings a little bit better..."
<USER>: "<USER>'ve gotten pretty passionate about this, huh?"
<USER>: "I hope you keep it up."
Sayori: "Writing's the best!"
Sayori: "I'm gonna keep writing until I die!"
<USER>: "Ahaha...don't get ahead of yourself."
*Sayori's always had a habit of getting obsessed with something, before dropping it no more than a week later.*
*I wonder if this is one of those times?*
*But seeing the passion in her eyes makes it hard for me to be pessimistic.*
<USER>: "Hmm...it's very...freeform, if that's what you call it."
<USER>: "Sorry, I'm not really the right person to ask for feedback..."
Monika: "That is, a lot of poems have been putting emphasis on the timing between words and lines."
<USER>: "What was the inspiration behind this one?"
Monika: "Ah..."
Monika: "It's been influencing my poems a bit."
<USER>: "An epiphany?"
Monika: "I'm kind of nervous to talk about deep stuff like that, because it's kind of coming on strongly..."
Monika: "Maybe after everyone is better friends with each other."
Monika: "Sometimes when you're writing a poem - or a story - your brain gets too fixated on a specific point..."
Monika: "If you try so hard to make it perfect, then you'll never make any progress."
Monika: "Just force yourself to get something down on the paper, and tidy it up later!"
Monika: "Another way to think about it is this"
Monika: "If you keep your pen in the same spot for too long, you'll just get a big dark puddle of ink."
Monika: "So just move your hand, and go with the flow!"
Monika: "Thanks for listening~"
<USER>: "Hm..."
<USER>: "It's even more abstract than your last one, huh?"
Monika: "I guess it's just the way I write..."
Monika: "I'm sorry if you don't like it."
<USER>: "No, I never said that."
<USER>: "It's just a kind of thing I've never really seen before, I guess."
Monika: "Choosing where and how to space your words can totally change the mood of the poem."
Monika: "The way I wrote the lines really short makes it feel like they're trying to speak over the noise."
<USER>: "I see..."
<USER>: "It's still hard for me to tell what it's about, though."
Monika: "A poem can be as abstract as a physical expression of a feeling."
Monika: "Or a conversation with the reader."
Monika: "So putting it that way, not every poem is {i}about{/i} something."
Monika: "Anyway..."
Monika: "Sometimes you'll find yourself facing a difficult decision..."
Monika: "When that happens, don't forget to save your game!"
Monika: "You never know when you might change your mind..."
Monika: "...or when something unexpected may happen!"
Monika: "Ahaha!"
Monika: "Thanks for listening~"
Monika: "I feel like learning and looking for answers are the sorts of things that give life meaning."
<USER>: "I see..."
<USER>: "I never really put much thought into it."
Monika: "Because if we had all the answers, wouldn't the world start to lose its meaning?"
<USER>: "<USER> know, there's one thing I noticed..."
<USER>: "It seems like everyone in the club prefers writing about things that are more sad than happy."
Monika: "We wouldn't really have anything to write about, would we?"
Monika: "Humans aren't two-dimensional creatures."
Monika: "I think you'd know that better than anyone."
<USER>: "<USER> mean one-dimensional...?"
Monika: "Are you ever too shy to share your writing because you're afraid it's not that good?"
Monika: "It can be really disheartening to get a lukewarm response to something you put so much into."
Monika: "But if you find other people who enjoy writing, then sharing becomes a lot easier!"
Monika: "Because instead of just telling you that your writing is good, or okay, or bad..."
Monika: "They'll want to focus more on everything that went into it, and the things you can work on."
Monika: "It's much more encouraging that way, and it will make you want to continue improving."
Monika: "It's almost like having your own little Literature Club, don't you think?"
Monika: "Thanks for listening~"
Natsuki: "..."
<USER>: "...?"
<USER>: "W-What??"
<USER>: "Harsh..."
Natsuki: "Do you think I'm stupid?"
<USER>: "I'm not a writer!"
<USER>: "Maybe it's not very good, but yeah, I did put in effort."
<USER>: "We all start somewhere, right?"
<USER>: "If you're still proud of the first poem {i}you{/i} ever wrote, then I'd like to read it."
<USER>: "Painful to think about?"
Natsuki: "Well, sorry."
Natsuki: "I'd tell you what to improve, but you're better off just trying again."
<USER>: "Fair enough..."
<USER>: "Well, to each their own, I guess."
Natsuki: "Knowing you, you'll probably think it's stupid."
Natsuki: "..."
<USER>: "...?"
<USER>: "That's a little blunt..."
Natsuki: "It's not like I said it was bad."
Natsuki: "It just didn't evoke any emotions."
<USER>: "So basically, it's not cute enough for your tastes?"
<USER>: "I'll pass..."
Natsuki: "..."
<USER>: "...?"
Natsuki: "First of all, um..."
<USER>: "..."
*Natsuki re-reads my poem.*
<USER>: "Eh? Then what's the point of sharing in the first place?"
<USER>: "I wrote this when I could have been doing other things."
<USER>: "In fact, remember how I said I wanted to read your poems?"
<USER>: "That's what I had in mind when writing this."
<USER>: "I want to help you feel comfortable enough to share yours."
<USER>: "Like Monika said."
Natsuki: "I hope you're happy!"
<USER>: "..."
<USER>: "...So, in other words, you're saying you liked it?"
*Natsuki's retort gets caught in her throat.*
Natsuki: "You just...you...don't understand anything, do you?"
<USER>: "Pretty sure you never actually said that..."
*I say that mostly to myself.*
*Natsuki must really hate me or something.*
*I can't figure out if it's a win or a loss that she liked my poem.*
<USER>: "In any case... <USER> still need to show me yours, right?"
Natsuki: "Only because Monika will make me if I don't."
Sayori: "...Wow!"
Sayori: "<USER>..."
Sayori: "Ahahaha!"
<USER>: "Eh?!"
Sayori: "It's your first time."
Sayori: "Besides..."
Sayori: "..."
Sayori: "Are you sure it's your first time?"
<USER>: "Of course..."
<USER>: "It's not that good."
<USER>: "Am I the kind of guy who would be writing poems in his spare time?"
Sayori: "I was afraid that you wouldn't do it seriously..."
Sayori: "Or that you wouldn't write one at all."
Sayori: "...Oh my goodness!"
<USER>: "Eh?"
Sayori: "I had no idea you were such a good writer!"
<USER>: "Sayori..."
<USER>: "<USER> must be seriously overreacting."
<USER>: "I'm not a good writer at all."
<USER>: "I honestly have no idea what I'm doing."
Sayori: "Maybe that's why!"
Sayori: "Because I have no idea what I like, either!"
<USER>: "Jeez..."
<USER>: "Are you sure you don't like it just because I wrote it?"
Sayori: "Well, I'm sure that's part of it."
Sayori: "So when I read your poem..."
Sayori: "It's not just a poem..."
Sayori: "And that makes it feel extra special!"
Sayori: "Like I can feel your feelings in it~"
*Sayori hugs the sheet against her chest.*
<USER>: "<USER>'re so weird, Sayori..."
Sayori: "Ehehe..."
Sayori: "..."
Sayori: "It's like I never know what I'm going to get!"
<USER>: "So basically you're saying it sucks."
Sayori: "Yuri must have spoiled me a little bit with her poems..."
Sayori: "Ehehe..."
<USER>: "It's fine, it's fine."
<USER>: "After all, I still have no idea what kinds of writing you even like."
Sayori: "..."
Sayori: "It's nice, I guess~"
<USER>: "Come on, I can already tell you don't like it."
Sayori: "You don't need to worry about what I think."
Sayori: "Probably [currentname]..."
<USER>: "Eh??"
<USER>: "I didn't write this for anyone specifically!"
Sayori: "Maybe..."
Sayori: "But it's okay."
Sayori: "You're making new friends, just like I was hoping."
Sayori: "And you're happy too, right?"
<USER>: "Well..."
<USER>: "Of course I am."
Sayori: "That's all that matters to me."
<USER>: "Sayori..."
<USER>: "Is there something wrong?"
Sayori: "I'm just a little tired today."
<USER>: "Alright..."
<USER>: "Just tell me if you need anything."
Sayori: "Don't worry about me, okay?"
Sayori: "You can go play with everyone else now."
<USER>: "If you insist..."
<USER>: "Sayori...?"
Sayori: "I'll see you tomorrow~"
*Before I can say anything else, Sayori cheerfully walks out of the classroom, humming to herself.*
Sayori: "This is your best one so far."
Sayori: "It's really really nice, <USER>~"
<USER>: "Er-- Thanks."
<USER>: "..."
<USER>: "Sayori, you've been a little quiet today."
<USER>: "Is everything alright?"
Sayori: "Of course!"
Sayori: "Maybe I'm just a little tired today."
<USER>: "Do you want to nap or something?"
Sayori: "Don't worry about me, okay?"
<USER>: "Well, alright..."
Sayori: "I'm still a little surprised."
Sayori: "I really thought that you would try writing your poems like the way Yuri does..."
Sayori: "But in the end..."
<USER>: "...Yeah."
<USER>: "I guess you're the one who likes this one the most."
Sayori: "You don't want to get closer with everyone else?"
<USER>: "Wait!"
<USER>: "Of course I do!"
<USER>: "But that doesn't mean I need to try so hard to impress them."
<USER>: "I still understand you the most, Sayori."
<USER>: "I know you have to sometimes put up with me."
<USER>: "And I have to sometimes put up with you."
<USER>: "But we have...a wavelength or something."
<USER>: "And this is how the poem came out."
<USER>: "Sometimes it feels like you're the only exciting thing in my life."
<USER>: "So sometimes it's just easier to write when thinking about you."
<USER>: "...Sayori?"
Sayori: "<USER>..."
Sayori: "I don't...deserve this..."
Sayori: "You're too nice to me..."
Sayori: "Why are you doing this...?"
*Sayori has trouble keeping her voice steady, all of a sudden.*
Sayori: "If you had fun with everyone else instead..."
Sayori: "This would be...so much easier!"
<USER>: "Sayori...!"
*I glance around the room to make sure nobody has noticed this.*
<USER>: "Sayori."
<USER>: "I've probably never said this before, but I don't understand what you're feeling right now."
<USER>: "Tell me what will cheer you up."
*Sayori shakes her head.*
*She sniffles and keeps shaking her head.*
*Finally, she gathers herself and puts on a smile.*
Sayori: "It's just a little raincloud."
Sayori: "I promise it won't happen again."
Sayori: "That's all that matters."
Sayori: "Go play with everyone else."
Sayori: "I'm gonna go home a little bit early today~"
<USER>: "Sayori--"
Sayori: "I'll see you tomorrow~"
*Before I can say anything else, Sayori cheerfully walks out of the classroom, humming to herself.*
Yuri: "Mm..."
Yuri: "..."
*Yuri stares at the poem.*
*A minute passes, more than enough time for her to finish reading.*
<USER>: "Um..."
Yuri: "Oh!"
Yuri: "I forgot to start speaking..."
Yuri: "U-Um!"
<USER>: "It's fine, don't force yourself."
Yuri: "I just need to put my thoughts into words."
Yuri: "Hold on..."
Yuri: "...Okay."
<USER>: "Er, yeah..."
<USER>: "Why do you ask?"
Yuri: "I'm just making sure."
Yuri: "I guessed that it might be after reading through it."
<USER>: "Ah, so it's that bad."
*Yuri buries her face in her hands.*
*I couldn't help but notice that it's been several minutes and we really haven't gotten anywhere.*
*It might take Yuri a while to get used to new people...*
<USER>: "It's fine, I really didn't notice."
<USER>: "What were you saying?"
*As Yuri reads the poem, I notice her eyes lighten.*
<USER>: "Eh? What was that?"
Yuri: "...?"
*Yuri first covers her mouth, but then ends up covering her whole face.*
Yuri: "Uu..."
Yuri: "{i}(He's going to hate me...){/i}"
<USER>: "Um..."
<USER>: "<USER> really didn't do anything wrong, Yuri..."
Yuri: "That's..."
Yuri: "What am I getting so nervous for?"
Yuri: "A-Ahaha..."
*Yuri takes a breath.*
Yuri: "So..."
Yuri: "Your use of imagery and metaphors indicates you've written a lot of poetry before."
<USER>: "Really...?"
<USER>: "Wow, that's a huge compliment coming from you."
<USER>: "This is actually my first time, really."
*Yuri stares at me blankly, then looks at my poem again.*
Yuri: "..."
Yuri: "I just meant...u-um..."
*Yuri trails off, unable to find an excuse.*
*She traces her finger along the words in the poem, as if breaking it down more thoroughly.*
Yuri: "Okay."
Yuri: "This is the reason I was able to tell."
Monika: "Having a good time so far?"
<USER>: "Ah...yeah."
Monika: "If you ever have any suggestions for the club, like new activities, or things we can do better..."
Monika: "Don't be afraid to bring things up, okay?"
<USER>: "Alright...I'll keep that in mind."
*Of course I'll be afraid to bring things up.*
*I'm much better off just going with the flow until I'm more settled in.*
Monika: "Want to share your poem with me?"
<USER>: "It's kind of embarrassing, but I guess I have to."
Monika: "Don't worry, <USER>!"
Monika: "We're all a little embarrassed today, you know?"
Monika: "But it's that sort of barrier that we'll all learn to get past soon."
<USER>: "Yeah, that's true."
*I hand Monika my poem.*
<USER>: "I'm sure I'll end up trying different things a lot."
<USER>: "It could take a while before I feel comfortable doing this."
Monika: "That's the best way to find the kind of style that suits you."
Monika: "So don't force yourself to write the way everyone else wants you to write."
Monika: "It's not like you have to worry about impressing them or anything."
<USER>: "Ahaha..."
<USER>: "<USER> sound pretty confident for someone who claims to not be very good."
<USER>: "I see..."
<USER>: "Well, let's read it, then."
Monika: "Have you thought about what you want to submit to perform at the festival?"
<USER>: "Well..."
*Being in this club is one thing, but performing in front of a bunch of people...*
<USER>: "...I'll have to give it some more thought."
Monika: "But whatever you do, I'm sure it'll turn out great."
Monika: "It would also make me happy to see."
<USER>: "Really...?"
<USER>: "Oh jeez..."
Monika: "It kind of makes me think of something Natsuki would write."
Monika: "And she's a good writer, too."
<USER>: "Ahaha..."
<USER>: "If you say so."
Monika: "Yep!"
<USER>: "Eh?"
<USER>: "Maybe a long time ago..."
Monika: "He's famous for telling all kinds of stories in just a few simple words."
Monika: "His poems can be funny, endearing, or even sad..."
Monika: "They might even feel like they're written for kids, but if you think about them..."
Monika: "They can express views of the world that would apply to anybody."
<USER>: "I see..."
<USER>: "So you're saying that Natsuki is kind of like that?"
Monika: "Maybe she's not an expert..."
Monika: "But you probably won't find much filler in her poems."
Monika: "They might be easy to write, but they're super challenging to get the meaning through."
Monika: "It makes me think of something Sayori would like."
<USER>: "Is that so?"
Monika: "I wouldn't be surprised if you had those sorts of things in common."
<USER>: "Ah, well..."
<USER>: "We may be good friends, but Sayori and I are actually really different."
Monika: "Hmm..."
Monika: "Well, that may be the case."
Monika: "The way she talks about you..."
Monika: "It sounds like the two of you really care about each other's well-being."
Monika: "Even if you show it in different ways, it ends up being more similar than you'd think."
<USER>: "Hmm..."
<USER>: "<USER> sure you're not reading into it too much?"
Monika: "Oh gosh, I sound like Yuri..."
Monika: "I can tell that she likes exploring with emotions, like happiness and sadness."
Monika: "Who knew that someone so happy would enjoy sad things, too?"
<USER>: "Yeah... That's totally unexpected."
Monika: "I was going 'Ooh' in my head while reading it."
<USER>: "It's easiest for me to keep everyone's expectations low."
<USER>: "That way, it always counts when I put in some effort."
Monika: "Well, I guess it worked, anyway."
Monika: "Writing that's full of imagery and symbolism."
Monika: "Yuri likes it when readers are left to derive their own meaning out of it."
Monika: "Both allowing people to get something out of it just by feel..."
Monika: "Or letting them deeply analyze all of the nuances."
Monika: "It can take years of practice, which I'm assuming Yuri has at this point."
<USER>: "I'm sure I'm nowhere near her level yet."
Monika: "You do your own thing."
Monika: "Just keep exploring, and learn by trying new things!"
Monika: "You must like her writing style."
<USER>: "Ah, yeah..."
<USER>: "I think it's a neat way to tell a story."
Monika: "Natsuki's poems may be cute, but they're also meaningful."
Monika: "I can see why you'd be into the style."
Monika: "I guess that means you're not as much a fan of Yuri's poems, then?"
<USER>: "Ah-- I wouldn't say that..."
<USER>: "I kind of like everyone's poems."
Monika: "Like Yuri's use of complex words and symbolism..."
Monika: "Or Sayori's way of expressing happiness or sadness in a more direct way."
<USER>: "Ahaha... That's kind of exaggerating it."
Monika: "But you do spend a lot of time with her even in this club, don't you?"
<USER>: "I-I'm not shy, it's just..."
Monika: "I know it takes a bit of time to make friends with everyone."
Monika: "And you can talk to me every now and then too..."
<USER>: "Ah, no, it's nothing like that..."
<USER>: "I'm just still getting used to being here, that's all."
Monika: "I really didn't mean it like that."
<USER>: "No, don't worry."
<USER>: "I get what you're saying."
Monika: "It feels like you're not only getting more comfortable with your style..."
Monika: "But the imagery is better than the last one I read!"
<USER>: "Hmm..."
<USER>: "I guess so."
<USER>: "<USER> can't deny that she's talented."
Monika: "...Romantic."
<USER>: "I noticed that, too."
<USER>: "Or when she's talking about literature, it's like a light turns on inside her."
Monika: "Sadly, it's hard to get much personal conversation out of her..."
Monika: "Who knows what goes on in that head of hers?"
<USER>: "I hope you don't mean that in a bad way."
Monika: "I just meant that I wish she didn't keep so much to herself..."
<USER>: "Eh?!"
<USER>: "<USER>...completely misunderstood!"
Monika: "Ahaha! Calm down, I'm kidding!"
<USER>: "Wait, really?"
*Monika kind of whispers that last part to me.*
<USER>: "...Well, there's not really anything wrong with that!"
Monika: "I was just saying~"
Monika: "You really like Natsuki, don't you?"
<USER>: "Eh? That's--"
Monika: "It's awfully suspicious, you know?"
Monika: "Spending time with her in the clubroom every day..."
Monika: "Pretending to like the manga that she's into..."
<USER>: "Y-<USER> know how Natsuki is...!"
<USER>: "If I don't indulge her, she'll end up hating me."
Monika: "It's not like Natsuki just hates anyone who doesn't give her what she wants."
Monika: "In fact, I think you're the only one who's indulged her as much as you have."
<USER>: "Is that so..."
*I kind of knew that, but I just didn't want to admit it.*
Monika: "So, I just need to ask one thing of you..."
Monika: "Natsuki is kind of unpredictable."
Monika: "A lot of times, she doesn't even know what she wants."
Monika: "She might not know how to handle her own feelings properly."
Monika: "What I'm saying is..."
<USER>: "That's--"
*I'm not sure how to respond to Monika.*
*While I care about her and the club, it's also kind of unfair to bring that up.*
Monika: "Well...you're smart."
Monika: "I'm sure you'll do the right thing."
*Monika smiles sweetly.*
Monika: "It's kind of funny..."
<USER>: "How so?"
Monika: "I'm surprised you're so in sync with her."
<USER>: "Ah, I guess you could say that..."
<USER>: "Although we kind of grew up as best friends, I haven't been seeing as much of her this past year..."
<USER>: "But since I joined the club, we've been spending a lot of time together again."
Monika: "That reminds me..."
Monika: "About how Sayori's been a little bit off today..."
<USER>: "Yeah? Did she tell you something?"
Monika: "Well..."
<USER>: "O-Of course not!"
<USER>: "I've been treating her like I always do."
Monika: "I know how much you care about her..."
Monika: "It would be terrible if something bad happened to her, so keep an eye on her."
Monika: "What could have happened all of a sudden...?"
<USER>: "..."
Monika: "This really isn't the time to be talking about this..."
Monika: "Yuri's been teaching you a lot of things, hasn't she?"
<USER>: "Well--"
<USER>: "I guess so."
Monika: "Not sure how you did it, but that's pretty impressive..."
<USER>: "Well, she just needs some patience and a way to talk about all the things in her head, I guess..."
<USER>: "I'm still getting the hang of it, myself."
Monika: "You're certainly putting in a lot of effort."
<USER>: "Eh? That's--"
Monika: "It's awfully suspicious, you know?"
Monika: "Spending time with her in the clubroom every day..."
Monika: "Reading that edgy novel with her..."
<USER>: "Well--!"
<USER>: "I just...feel bad that she has a hard time socializing."
<USER>: "It makes me want to make sure she doesn't spend all her time alone."
<USER>: "Besides, the novel isn't too bad either, you know..."
Monika: "I get you."
Monika: "I know that Yuri isn't used to opening herself up..."
Monika: "Then it could be really hard for her."
Monika: "They're just a bandage."
<USER>: "<USER> say that like I'm going to hurt her..."
Monika: "If anything, she might accidentally hurt herself."
Yuri: "It doesn't really matter what it's about."
Yuri: "My mind has been a little hyperactive lately, so I had to take it out on your pen."
Yuri: "I, um..."
Yuri: "So I wrote this...poem...with it."
Yuri: "And now you're touching it..."
Yuri: "..."
Yuri: "You can keep the poem, though..."
Yuri: "Do you like it??"
Yuri: "I wrote it for you!"
Yuri: "In case you couldn't tell, the poem is about [gtext]"
Yuri: "See, aren't I the most thoughtful person in the club?"
Yuri: "..."
Yuri: "I think I'm...going to vomit."
Natsuki: "Why didn't you come read with me today?"
Natsuki: "I was waiting for a long time."
Natsuki: "It was the only thing I had to look forward to today."
Natsuki: "Why did you ruin it?"
Natsuki: "Do you like Yuri more?"
Natsuki: "Are you listening to me?"
Natsuki: "That should be obvious by now."
Natsuki: "So just play with me instead."
Natsuki: "Okay?"
Natsuki: "You don't hate me, <USER>, do you?"
Natsuki: "Do you hate me?"
Natsuki: "Do you want to make me go home crying?"
Natsuki: "The club is the only place I feel safe."
Natsuki: "Don't ruin that for me."
Natsuki: "Don't ruin it."
Natsuki: "Please."
Natsuki: "Just stop talking to Yuri."
Natsuki: "Play with me instead."
Natsuki: "It's all I have..."
Natsuki: "Play with me."
Natsuki: "I changed my mind."
Natsuki: "Ignore everything you just read."
Natsuki: "There's no point in trying to do anything."
Natsuki: "It's Yuri's own fault that she's so unlikable."
Natsuki: "Can you hear me, <USER>?"
Natsuki: "If you would just spend more time with Monika, all these problems would go away."
Natsuki: "Yuri and I are too messed up for someone as wonderful as you."
Natsuki: "Just think of Monika from now on."
Natsuki: "Just Monika."
*Just Monika.*
Monika: "I'm just trying to...um..."
Monika: "There's no point in explaining."
Monika: "Sometimes you'll find yourself facing a difficult decision..."
Monika: "When that happens, don't forget to save your game!"
Monika: "Can you hear me?"
Monika: "Anything."
Monika: "Thanks for listening~"
Monika: "Jeez! That really startled me!{fast}"
Monika: "Um..."
Monika: "I was just trying to..."
Monika: "Let's just move on..."
Natsuki: "You gave your poem to Yuri?"
Natsuki: "What is with you two?"
Natsuki: "It's not like I wanted to read it anyway."
Natsuki: "I really hate that I have to do this."
Natsuki: "But unfortunately I don't have much of a choice."
Natsuki: "Then you can go away."
Yuri: "Let's see what you've written for today."
*Yuri smiles and takes a deep breath.*
Yuri: "I like just holding it."
<USER>: "...?"
Yuri: "The poem turned out good!"
Yuri: "But that doesn't really matter."
Yuri: "L-Let's move on..."
Yuri: "You don't have to like it or anything..."
*Yuri holds my poem to her face and takes a deep breath.*
Yuri: "I love everything about it."
Yuri: "Will you let me keep it?"
Yuri: "Please?"
<USER>: "Sure, I don't care..."
Yuri: "You're too nice to me, <USER>..."
Yuri: "I've never met anyone as nice as you."
Yuri: "I just don't know how to describe it."
Yuri: "It's okay to be feeling this way, right?"
Yuri: "It's not bad, right?"
*Yuri holds my poem to her chest.*
Yuri: "I hope that it makes you feel good when you think about me having it."
Yuri: "I'll give myself paper cuts so your skin oil enters my bloodstream."
Yuri: "Besides, after you read it, I know you're really going to want to keep it."
Monika: "Having a good time so far?"
<USER>: "Ah...yeah."
Monika: "If you ever have any suggestions for the club, like new activities, or things we can do better..."
Monika: "Don't be afraid to bring things up, okay?"
<USER>: "Alright...I'll keep that in mind."
*Of course I'll be afraid to bring things up.*
*I'm much better off just going with the flow until I'm more settled in.*
Monika: "Want to share your poem with me?"
<USER>: "It's kind of embarrassing, but I guess I have to."
Monika: "Don't worry, <USER>!"
Monika: "We're all a little embarrassed today, you know?"
Monika: "But it's that sort of barrier that we'll all learn to get past soon."
<USER>: "Yeah, that's true."
*I hand Monika my poem.*
<USER>: "<USER> sound pretty confident for someone who claims to not be very good."
<USER>: "I see..."
<USER>: "Well, let's read it, then."
Monika: "You want to read my poem now?"
Monika: "I like the way this one turned out, so I hope you do too~"
<USER>: "Really...?"
<USER>: "Oh jeez..."
Monika: "It kind of makes me think of something Natsuki would write."
Monika: "And she's a good writer, too."
<USER>: "Ahaha..."
<USER>: "If you say so."
Monika: "Yep!"
Monika: "She'll cling to you like a puppy."
Monika: "But sometimes she just loses all of her strength and shuts down."
Monika: "Like earlier."
Monika: "I was going 'Ooh' in my head while reading it."
<USER>: "It's easiest for me to keep everyone's expectations low."
<USER>: "That way, it always counts when I put in some effort."
Monika: "Well, I guess it worked, anyway."
Monika: "Writing that's full of imagery and symbolism."
Monika: "I don't mean that like it's a bad thing, though."
Monika: "She spends so much time in her own head that it's probably a much more interesting place for her..."
Monika: "I don't think she's used to being indulged like that."
Monika: "I think if she gets too stimulated, she ends up withdrawing and looking for alone time."
*Suddenly, the door opens.*
Yuri: "I'm back..."
Yuri: "Did I miss anything?"
Monika: "Well, we all started sharing our poems with each other."
Yuri: "Already?"
Yuri: "Thanks, Monika."
Yuri: "I suppose I should go get my poem now."
Monika: "I didn't want to have to tell you this, but I don't think I have a choice."
Monika: "But when Yuri gets too excited, she finds a place to hide and starts cutting herself with a pocket knife."
Monika: "She even brings a different one to school every day, like she has a collection or something..."
Monika: "I think she just gets some kind of high from it."
Monika: "So I think if you keep your distance, that would probably be best for her."
Monika: "To put it lightly, I at least have it together in the head...and I know how to treat my club members."
