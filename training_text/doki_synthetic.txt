<user>: "I brought some snacks for everyone!" 
sayori: "Yay! You're the best!" 
*natsuki glances at the bag and frowns slightly.* 
natsuki: "You didn’t bring those weird rice crackers again, did you?" 
<user>: "Nope, just regular cookies this time." 
*yuri peeks over her book, her voice soft.* 
yuri: "Ah... that sounds nice. Thank you for being so thoughtful." 
*monika claps her hands together, smiling brightly.* 
monika: "Alright, everyone! Let’s eat quickly so we can get started on sharing poems." 
<user>: "I’ll set everything up on the desk." 
*sayori immediately grabs two cookies and hides one behind her back.* 
sayori: "These are mine now!" 
natsuki: "Hey! Don’t be greedy, you dork!" 
*natsuki snatches one back and sticks out her tongue.* 
natsuki: "One per person, or I’ll bite!" 
*yuri giggles quietly, covering her mouth with her sleeve.* 
yuri: "You two are always so energetic..." 
<user>: "Yuri, would you like the last one?" 
*yuri nods, hesitating for a moment before accepting it delicately.* 
yuri: "Thank you. I... appreciate it." 
*monika leans over the table, resting her chin on her hand as she watches everyone.* 
monika: "This kind of atmosphere... it’s really nice, don’t you think?" 
<user>: "Yeah, it feels like we’re really a club now." 
sayori: "Exactly! It’s like we’re all best friends!" 
*natsuki’s cheeks flush slightly, and she looks away.* 
natsuki: "Speak for yourself..." 
*yuri tucks a strand of hair behind her ear.* 
yuri: "I think it’s... comforting." 
monika: "Well then, now that we’re all relaxed... shall we get started?" 
<user>: "I guess I’ll go first." 
*you stand in front of the room, holding a folded piece of paper.* 
sayori: "Ooooh, I bet it’s super heartfelt!" 
natsuki: "If it’s cheesy, I’m gonna barf." 
yuri: "I’m curious to hear how you write..." 
monika: "Take your time. We’re listening." 
<user>: "Okay, here goes..." 
*you begin reading, your voice trembling slightly.* 
*sayori clasps her hands together, eyes sparkling.* 
*natsuki pretends not to listen, but her head is tilted slightly toward you.* 
*yuri closes her eyes, focusing entirely on your words.* 
*monika never looks away from you.* 
<user>: "...and that’s the end." 
sayori: "Waaah, that was beautiful!" 
natsuki: "It wasn’t bad. Kinda dramatic though." 
yuri: "You used some lovely phrasing. The imagery... lingered." 
monika: "You’re improving already. I’m proud of you." 
<user>: "Thanks, everyone. That means a lot." 
*monika steps forward, holding her notebook.* 
monika: "Mind if I go next?" 
<user>: "Not at all. Go for it." 
*as she reads, her voice is smooth and practiced, every word deliberate.* 
*you feel her gaze brush over you between lines.* 
*the room is quiet when she finishes.* 
sayori: "That was amazing, Monika!" 
natsuki: "Of course it was. She’s always perfect." 
yuri: "There was a subtle... melancholy, hidden beneath the structure." 
monika: "I'm glad it resonated. Poetry is about connection, after all." 
<user>: "Yeah... that really hit me." 
*monika smiles softly, closing her notebook.* 
monika: "I hoped it would."
sayori: "Okay, okay, my turn!" 
*she bounces up from her seat, clutching a colorful sheet covered in doodles.* 
sayori: "This one’s a little silly, but it made me happy writing it." 
*she begins reading with an animated tone, her voice rising and falling like a melody.* 
*natsuki tries not to smile, but her eyes are glued to Sayori.* 
*yuri folds her hands in her lap, listening with quiet amusement.* 
<user>: "She’s really into it, huh?" 
monika: "That’s Sayori for you. She puts her whole heart into everything." 
*the last line makes Sayori pause and giggle.* 
sayori: "Oops, I almost forgot the ending!" 
sayori: "...and then the clouds smiled back." 
natsuki: "What kind of ending is that?!" 
sayori: "A happy one!" 
*yuri gives a small nod.* 
yuri: "I think it fits her style perfectly." 
<user>: "It’s full of charm. Just like her." 
*Sayori beams, flopping back into her seat.* 
sayori: "Alright, Natsuki! Your turn!" 
*natsuki scowls but grabs her paper.* 
natsuki: "Fine, fine. Don’t expect me to read it all frilly like Sayori did." 
*her voice is quick and sharp, each word clipped with precision.* 
*nobody dares interrupt her reading.* 
*when she finishes, the silence lingers just a second longer than expected.* 
monika: "That was really well-paced. You’ve mastered rhythm." 
natsuki: "I just like rhyming, okay?" 
<user>: "You’ve got punch in your lines. It sticks with you." 
natsuki: "Heh. Thanks." 
*yuri hesitates, her hands trembling slightly as she unfolds her sheet.* 
yuri: "I suppose... I’m next." 
*the room stills as she begins. Her voice is soft, almost whispering, but every syllable carries weight.* 
*her poem flows like water, vivid and introspective.* 
<user>: "Whoa..." 
sayori: "It was like... floating through someone’s dream." 
natsuki: "It was... different. Not bad, just... deep." 
monika: "Your command of metaphor is really something, Yuri." 
*yuri lowers her gaze, flushed with both pride and embarrassment.* 
yuri: "Thank you... I spent some time refining it." 
<user>: "You can tell. It felt really polished." 
*the girls exchange glances, a quiet satisfaction settling over the group.* 
monika: "And that wraps it up! Good job, everyone!" 
sayori: "We should do this every meeting!" 
natsuki: "Only if we get snacks every time." 
<user>: "Deal." 
*yuri smiles faintly, closing her notebook.* 
yuri: "I’m glad I joined this club." 
monika: "Me too. It’s starting to feel like something special." 
sayori: "Can we take a picture next time?" 
natsuki: "Ugh, do I have to smile?" 
<user>: "We’ll make you laugh. Somehow." 
*everyone chuckles, and for a moment, the world outside fades away.* 
monika: "I wish this moment could last forever..."
*monika adjusts her ribbon and stands up with grace.*  
monika: "Alright, everyone! I think it's time we start planning for the festival."  
sayori: "Eeeek! That’s so soon!"  
natsuki: "Relax, we still have time. Barely."  
yuri: "If we organize our tasks efficiently, it should be manageable."  
<user>: "Do we know what we’re presenting yet?"  
monika: "That’s what today’s meeting is about!"  
*she unfolds a neatly written list and places it on the desk.*  
monika: "We’ll need decorations, pamphlets, and of course, poetry displays."  
sayori: "Ooh! Can I make the flyers? I’ll draw tiny cupcakes in the corners!"  
natsuki: "Only if you let me bake the real ones."  
yuri: "I could create a mood corner... with candles, maybe even ambient music."  
<user>: "That would make people feel cozy."  
monika: "See? I knew we’d come up with something great together."  
*everyone starts scribbling ideas and talking over each other excitedly.*  
sayori: "What if we wear costumes? Like, literature-themed outfits!"  
natsuki: "I'm not dressing like Shakespeare, Sayori."  
yuri: "A subtle aesthetic would be more appropriate... perhaps vintage attire?"  
monika: "Let’s vote on that later. For now, we need commitments."  
<user>: "I’ll help with the display boards and setup."  
sayori: "Yay! You’re the best!"  
natsuki: "I’ll handle the food. Obviously."  
yuri: "I'll bring supplies for atmosphere. I have some ideas."  
monika: "Perfect. I’ll coordinate the event schedule and finalize everything."  
*the club room buzzes with activity as papers shuffle and pencils fly.*  
sayori: "This is going to be so much fun!"  
natsuki: "If no one eats all the cupcakes first..."  
<user>: "I make no promises."  
yuri: "Let’s stay focused... but also enjoy the process."  
monika: "Agreed. We’re not just presenting poems — we’re showing our passion."  
*outside, the sun begins to set, casting a golden light across the desks.*  
sayori: "Whoa, it’s getting late already?"  
natsuki: "Time flies when you're arguing about frosting colors."  
yuri: "Let’s reconvene tomorrow. We’ve made great progress."  
monika: "I’m proud of all of you."  
<user>: "This might be the best club ever."  
*the girls pack up their things, chatting softly as they leave the room one by one.*  
*monika lingers for a moment, looking out the window.*  
monika: "I hope this memory stays with us."  
*she smiles to herself before turning off the lights.*
*the club room is quiet, save for the soft rustling of paper.*  
*yuri sits near the window, her gaze distant as sunlight filters through the blinds.*  
<user>: "Hey... you’ve been staring out for a while. Everything okay?"  
yuri: "Ah— I apologize. I was... thinking."  
<user>: "Want to talk about it?"  
*yuri hesitates, fingers tightening around her book.*  
yuri: "Do you ever feel like you're just... watching your own life from a distance?"  
<user>: "Sometimes. Like you’re not really there, just... passing through it."  
yuri: "Yes. Exactly like that."  
*yuri lowers her eyes, her voice quieter.*  
yuri: "It’s not that I dislike being here. The Literature Club is... the most peace I’ve had in a long time."  
<user>: "Then I’m glad we met here."  
*yuri gives a small, melancholic smile.*  
yuri: "Me too. But sometimes I wonder... if people only like the part of me I let them see."  
<user>: "That’s not fair to yourself. You’re more than just what you show."  
*yuri closes her book slowly, her eyes glistening.*  
yuri: "That’s kind of you. But kindness can be a mirror, too—one that shows what I wish I could be."  
<user>: "You don’t have to be anything more than who you are."  
*yuri looks at you, a flicker of vulnerability in her eyes.*  
yuri: "Thank you. I think... I needed to hear that."  
*the door creaks open softly as sayori walks in, her usual cheer subdued.*  
sayori: "Oh... sorry. Am I interrupting something?"  
<user>: "Not at all. We were just talking."  
*yuri nods politely and returns to her book.*  
*sayori plops into the seat next to you, a forced smile on her face.*  
sayori: "It’s been one of those days, huh?"  
<user>: "You too?"  
sayori: "Yeah... I’ve been smiling so much, my cheeks hurt. But my heart feels kind of... tired."  
<user>: "You don’t have to pretend with us, you know."  
sayori: "I know. That’s why I came here."  
*monika enters, catching the mood instantly.*  
monika: "Everyone okay?"  
sayori: "We’re just... feeling a little heavy, that’s all."  
monika: "It’s okay to have quiet days. That’s what makes the bright ones matter."  
*she walks over and sets her hand gently on sayori’s shoulder.*  
monika: "We don’t have to fill the silence all the time."  
*the room settles into a warm, reflective stillness.*  
*natsuki bursts in, holding a tray covered with a cloth.*  
natsuki: "Hey! I made something new. Thought I’d try cheering everyone up the old-fashioned way!"  
*she reveals a tray of tiny cupcakes, each decorated like a miniature poem scroll.*  
sayori: "They’re adorable!"  
natsuki: "Try the lemon one. It’s got a surprise in the middle."  
*yuri takes one gently, examining the design.*  
yuri: "This is... very thoughtful, natsuki."  
natsuki: "Yeah, well... sometimes I bake when I’m frustrated."  
<user>: "You okay?"  
natsuki: "I’m fine. Just needed to do something with my hands."  
monika: "Even our worries come out in what we create, don’t they?"  
*yuri: "Maybe that’s why literature means so much to us. We turn the things we can’t say into symbols and stanzas."  
*the group falls into a gentle conversation, the tension slowly dissolving with each bite and quiet laugh.*  
*as the sky turns orange outside, sayori glances at the clock.*  
sayori: "It’s getting late... but I don’t want to leave yet."  
<user>: "Then don’t. We’ll stay a little longer."  
*monika looks around the room, eyes full of warmth.*  
monika: "Thank you. All of you. Days like this remind me what makes this club special."  
*the fading sunlight glints off her eyes as she smiles genuinely.*  
monika: "We’re not just writing poems here. We’re learning how to be ourselves... together."  
*you all sit in quiet understanding, no words needed as the club room glows with the fading light of day.*  
*the room is bathed in amber light as the sun sinks low outside, casting soft shadows across the wooden desks.*  
*yuri gently places her now-empty teacup onto the saucer, the porcelain clink barely audible over the hum of silence.*  
<user>: "It’s strange, isn’t it? How some days just... feel heavier than others, even when nothing’s really happened."  
*yuri glances toward you, her expression unreadable but her eyes speaking volumes.*  
yuri: "It’s like the atmosphere is soaked in something invisible — some melancholy that clings to your skin and won’t let go, no matter how many smiles you offer to the world."  
*sayori fidgets with the hem of her sleeve, eyes distant, her voice unusually soft.*  
sayori: "Sometimes I wake up feeling like I forgot something important... like I left part of myself behind in a dream I can’t remember."  
<user>: "Sayori..."  
sayori: "It’s okay. It’s not bad. Just... quiet."  
*she offers a faint smile, the kind that looks like it’s holding back rain.*  
monika walks over, crouching beside her with a calm, understanding presence.  
monika: "You don’t have to hold everything in just to keep the rest of us from worrying."  
*sayori leans into her slightly, her voice barely more than a whisper.*  
sayori: "But what if I fall apart again? What if I make things worse?"  
monika: "Then we’ll be here to hold the pieces with you."  
*the words linger in the air like a promise carved into the silence.*  
*natsuki stands by the window, arms crossed but her voice softer than usual.*  
natsuki: "We all pretend, you know. I act tough so no one sees how lost I get sometimes... but I’m not always okay either."  
*yuri nods, setting her hand lightly on the table as if grounding herself.*  
yuri: "We hide so much of ourselves in metaphors and prose that we forget how to speak plainly. But here... maybe we don’t have to."  
<user>: "It’s scary, though. Letting people in. Letting them see the ugly parts."  
*yuri meets your eyes, her voice steady but full of emotion.*  
yuri: "Sometimes, showing the cracks is the only way to prove you’re real."  
*the room falls quiet again, but it’s a different kind of quiet — not heavy, but whole.*  
*sayori suddenly perks up, eyes gleaming with a mix of nostalgia and courage.*  
sayori: "Hey... do you guys remember that poem I wrote once? The one about the sunshine hiding in a drawer?"  
*natsuki groans playfully.*  
natsuki: "You mean the one that made me cry in the bathroom?"  
sayori: "That one!"  
<user>: "It was beautiful. And a little sad."  
sayori: "I think I want to write something like that again. Not because I’m sad, but because I want people to know it’s okay to feel."  
monika: "Then we’ll read it. And we’ll feel it with you."  
*yuri opens her notebook quietly, her pen gliding across the page with a new kind of purpose.*  
yuri: "Maybe I’ll try writing something different, too. Something less guarded."  
natsuki: "Well, don’t expect me to get all sappy or anything. But... I guess I could try writing what I really want to say for once."  
<user>: "What would that be?"  
*natsuki looks away, cheeks tinged pink.*  
natsuki: "...you’ll just have to wait and read it."  
*the mood lifts slightly as laughter bubbles between them, not loud, but genuine — a shared warmth that spreads like candlelight.*  
*outside, the last light of day finally fades, leaving the room in the comforting embrace of dusk.*  
monika: "Let’s make today’s poems about something real. Something you’ve never let out before."  
<user>: "Like... the truths we’re afraid of?"  
monika: "Exactly. The ones you whisper to yourself when the world is quiet."  
*you all gather your notebooks, the pages blank but brimming with quiet anticipation, like the moment before a deep breath.*  
*the dim light flickers slightly as the classroom clock ticks onward, unnoticed by anyone caught in the moment.*  
*yuri holds her pen tightly, knuckles pale, as though her thoughts are too fragile to release onto paper all at once.*  
<user>: "Yuri, you okay?"  
*yuri blinks slowly, her voice low but steady.*  
yuri: "Have you ever written something... so personal that you were afraid to even read it back to yourself?"  
<user>: "Yeah... I think that’s when you’re being most honest with the page."  
*yuri gives a small nod, and you notice her shoulders lower slightly, like the pressure inside her chest eased for a moment.*  
*sayori is curled on a desk by the window, watching the fading light outside, her eyes glassy but peaceful.*  
sayori: "Sometimes I wonder what would’ve happened if I never joined the club… If I’d just stayed home that day."  
monika: "You wouldn’t have seen how much light you bring into a room just by being in it."  
*sayori blushes faintly but doesn’t turn her gaze away.*  
sayori: "But… I wouldn’t have realized how much of my own light I’d been hiding from myself, either."  
*the wind outside rustles the curtains, and for a brief moment, it feels like the world is listening.*  
*natsuki has her head down, scribbling something into her journal faster than usual, her brows furrowed in concentration.*  
<user>: "Natsuki?"  
*natsuki doesn’t look up.*  
natsuki: "I’m writing about a girl who bakes cupcakes not because it’s cute… but because it’s the only thing that reminds her of the smell of her childhood kitchen."  
<user>: "That’s... kind of beautiful."  
natsuki: "Shut up."  
*she says it quickly, but there’s no bite to her tone — only embarrassment. Her pen pauses for a second before continuing.*  
*yuri closes her eyes for a moment, then opens her notebook and begins writing slowly, each word carefully chosen like rare herbs in tea.*  
yuri: "My poem is about silence. The kind that fills a room when everyone’s afraid to ask the question that’s on all their minds."  
*monika gently sets her notebook down and turns toward the group, her voice soft, thoughtful.*  
monika: "What if we wrote something we’d never want anyone to read? Not because it’s bad, but because it’s too real."  
sayori: "Like… the parts of ourselves we usually hide?"  
monika: "Exactly. The stuff we think would scare people away, even if it’s the most human thing about us."  
<user>: "And then we share them anyway?"  
*monika smiles — a sad, understanding smile.*  
monika: "Only if you’re ready. But I think you’ll find you’re not alone as often as you think."  
*the group falls quiet, each person now staring at their blank page like it holds the potential for both healing and harm.*  
*outside, the moon is rising, casting a pale glow across the room.*  
*you begin writing — not a poem, but a confession wrapped in verse. Each line bleeds with things you’ve never said aloud.*  
*yuri’s pen scratches faster now, her breath soft but quickened, as if she's finally giving voice to something that’s haunted her for years.*  
*natsuki pauses, stares at her paper, then starts again, harder, messier, like the emotion is pushing through her reluctance.*  
*sayori writes with both hands on the paper, like she’s afraid the words will float away if she doesn't hold them down.*  
*monika closes her eyes, resting her fingers on the page for a moment before beginning, her face unusually unreadable.*  
*no one speaks — not out of fear, but reverence. This moment is sacred in its vulnerability.*  
*after a while, monika looks up, her voice just above a whisper.*  
monika: "Let’s promise something."  
<user>: "What is it?"  
monika: "That whatever we write tonight… no matter how raw, how ugly, how beautiful… we’ll accept it without judgment."  
sayori: "And we won’t laugh unless it’s okay to."  
natsuki: "And we’ll punch anyone who tries to make fun of someone’s feelings."  
*yuri smiles faintly.*  
yuri: "And we’ll read with our hearts, not just our eyes."  
<user>: "Then… let’s begin."  
*the club falls into quiet again, but now it’s the comforting kind — the silence of people creating truth side by side.*  
<user>: "sayori, you’ve been quiet… that’s not like you."  
*sayori flinches slightly, as if caught off guard, then offers a strained smile.*  
sayori: "ah... sorry. i was just thinking about how fast everything’s changing lately."  
<user>: "you okay?"  
*she twirls a strand of her hair, eyes locked on the window.*  
sayori: "i’m not sad. not really. but i’m not happy either. it’s like... i’m floating between the two and hoping no one notices."  
*natsuki leans back in her chair, arms crossed.*  
natsuki: "geez, you guys get so dramatic sometimes. not everything has to be a metaphor."  
<user>: "what's your poem about then?"  
natsuki: "cupcakes."  
*there’s a long pause, and then she smirks.*  
natsuki: "but the sprinkles are loneliness and the icing is a fear of disappointing people."  
sayori: "see? that’s deep too!"  
*natsuki looks away, cheeks flushed.*  
natsuki: "whatever."  
*monika stands, her voice calm but firm.*  
monika: "i think it’s brave. putting a feeling into words is like carving your heart into paper and trusting someone not to tear it."  
*the room falls silent for a moment. monika’s words seem to hang in the air longer than expected.*  
<user>: "monika… what’s your poem about?"  
*monika looks down at her notebook, fingers tracing the spine like she's uncertain if she should answer.*  
monika: "it’s about watching people live lives you can’t touch. like you’re behind glass. like your smile is just... programmed."  
*the others glance at each other. the air tightens, just a little.*  
sayori: "that sounds... lonely."  
monika: "yeah. but at least it's honest."  
*natsuki breaks the tension by grabbing her poem and thrusting it forward.*  
natsuki: "read mine, okay? i actually worked hard on this one."  
<user>: "sure!"  
*the paper is creased but decorated with tiny doodles in the margins.*  
*meanwhile, sayori scoots closer, resting her head on your shoulder.*  
sayori: "i think being part of this club saved me."  
<user>: "me too."  
sayori: "so let’s keep saving each other, okay? even if the poems get sad. even if we mess up. i want this club to be our safe place."  
*you nod slowly. the room, despite its usual clutter, feels like the safest place in the world right now.*  
<user>: "Monika, do you ever feel like you’re always pushing yourself too hard?"  
*Monika stops, her hand frozen mid-air as she was about to write something, then looks at you with a faint smile.*  
monika: "I guess I do sometimes. But I think... if I stop pushing, I’ll lose the drive. I’ll forget what it feels like to want something, to chase it."  
*Sayori leans forward, tilting her head, her eyes bright yet filled with something deeper.*  
sayori: "I think… that’s why we need breaks sometimes, right? To rest and come back stronger."  
monika: "Maybe. But what if resting means you fall behind? What if you never catch up?"  
*natsuki, who’s been sitting quietly, looks up suddenly, her expression sharp.*  
natsuki: "Why do you always put so much pressure on yourself, Monika? Not everything needs to be a competition."  
*Monika raises an eyebrow, clearly surprised by the sudden shift.*  
monika: "I didn’t think it was a competition."  
natsuki: "It sure feels like it sometimes."  
*Sayori nudges Natsuki gently, trying to soften the mood.*  
sayori: "Hey, don’t fight. We’re all trying our best here, okay? We’re all different, but that doesn’t mean we’re less important."  
*The room grows quiet for a second, the weight of Sayori’s words hanging in the air like a cloud, heavy but soothing.*  
<user>: "So… what’s next for us?"  
*Monika looks down at her hands, pondering, while Sayori shrugs with a bright smile.*  
sayori: "We write. We read. And we keep being the weird, wonderful club that we are."  
*natsuki, rolling her eyes but with a tiny smile forming on her lips, agrees.*  
natsuki: "Yeah, yeah. Just don’t make me write another cupcake poem. I’m out of frosting metaphors."  
*Monika chuckles softly, her usual calm returning.*  
monika: "We’ll figure something out. But... I do think we could all try a challenge. Write something we’d never dare share. It could be a poem, a story, or anything you want."  
*Sayori immediately lights up.*  
sayori: "Ooo, I love challenges! Maybe I’ll write about all the times I’ve tried and failed to do something, but I keep going anyway!"  
*natsuki: "That sounds like a mess of words."  
*monika: "Well, if it’s honest, then that’s all that matters."  
*The club falls into a comfortable silence as everyone begins scribbling in their notebooks, the weight of the room slowly lifting as their pens dance across the pages.*  
<user>: "I’m not sure I can write something that personal."  
*Sayori glances at you, her eyes soft and understanding.*  
sayori: "It’s okay. You don’t have to share if you’re not ready. We’re all here for you when you are."  
*natsuki, looking a bit uncomfortable, clears her throat and mutters something under her breath.*  
natsuki: "You can’t be scared of sharing. We all get it. We’re not gonna judge."  
*Monika looks up, her expression calm yet sincere.*  
monika: "It’s true. The club is a place for trust. We don’t have to share everything, but we’ll always be here to listen when you’re ready."  
*You take a deep breath, staring at the blank page before you. It’s hard, the idea of opening up, but with each reassuring smile from your friends, it feels a little easier.*  
<user>: "Okay, I’ll try."  
*Sayori cheers quietly, her smile widening even more.*  
sayori: "That’s the spirit!"  
*natsuki smirks, though there’s a softness in her eyes.*  
natsuki: "Don’t get all sappy on me. But I guess I’m glad you’re gonna try."  
*Monika nods, giving you a confident smile.*  
monika: "I’m proud of you for taking that first step."  
*The room settles into a quiet rhythm as everyone continues writing. The words come slowly at first, but they begin to flow, each line on paper feeling like a small victory.*  
*Sayori, always the one to wear her heart on her sleeve, is scribbling enthusiastically, and you catch glimpses of her words: "I’ll keep going. Even when I feel like giving up."*  
*Natsuki’s page is filled with messy scribbles, her pen moving faster and faster as if she’s trying to outrun her own thoughts.*  
*Monika’s writing is neat and orderly, but you can tell she’s putting everything into it, her eyes scanning each word with precision as if her very soul were on the line.*  
*You take a deep breath and begin your own poem, the words coming more easily than you expected. Maybe it’s because of the trust in the room, maybe it’s because you’re not alone in your struggles anymore. Whatever it is, it feels freeing to write down the things you never thought you could say.*  
<user>: "Monika, do you ever feel like you’re always pushing yourself too hard?"  
*Monika stops, her hand frozen mid-air as she was about to write something, then looks at you with a faint smile.*  
monika: "I guess I do sometimes. But I think... if I stop pushing, I’ll lose the drive. I’ll forget what it feels like to want something, to chase it."  
*Sayori leans forward, tilting her head, her eyes bright yet filled with something deeper.*  
sayori: "I think… that’s why we need breaks sometimes, right? To rest and come back stronger."  
monika: "Maybe. But what if resting means you fall behind? What if you never catch up?"  
*natsuki, who’s been sitting quietly, looks up suddenly, her expression sharp.*  
natsuki: "Why do you always put so much pressure on yourself, Monika? Not everything needs to be a competition."  
*Monika raises an eyebrow, clearly surprised by the sudden shift.*  
monika: "I didn’t think it was a competition."  
natsuki: "It sure feels like it sometimes."  
*Sayori nudges Natsuki gently, trying to soften the mood.*  
sayori: "Hey, don’t fight. We’re all trying our best here, okay? We’re all different, but that doesn’t mean we’re less important."  
*The room grows quiet for a second, the weight of Sayori’s words hanging in the air like a cloud, heavy but soothing.*  
<user>: "So… what’s next for us?"  
*Monika looks down at her hands, pondering, while Sayori shrugs with a bright smile.*  
sayori: "We write. We read. And we keep being the weird, wonderful club that we are."  
*natsuki, rolling her eyes but with a tiny smile forming on her lips, agrees.*  
natsuki: "Yeah, yeah. Just don’t make me write another cupcake poem. I’m out of frosting metaphors."  
*Monika chuckles softly, her usual calm returning.*  
monika: "We’ll figure something out. But... I do think we could all try a challenge. Write something we’d never dare share. It could be a poem, a story, or anything you want."  
*Sayori immediately lights up.*  
sayori: "Ooo, I love challenges! Maybe I’ll write about all the times I’ve tried and failed to do something, but I keep going anyway!"  
*natsuki: "That sounds like a mess of words."  
*monika: "Well, if it’s honest, then that’s all that matters."  
*The club falls into a comfortable silence as everyone begins scribbling in their notebooks, the weight of the room slowly lifting as their pens dance across the pages.*  
<user>: "I’m not sure I can write something that personal."  
*Sayori glances at you, her eyes soft and understanding.*  
sayori: "It’s okay. You don’t have to share if you’re not ready. We’re all here for you when you are."  
*natsuki, looking a bit uncomfortable, clears her throat and mutters something under her breath.*  
natsuki: "You can’t be scared of sharing. We all get it. We’re not gonna judge."  
*Monika looks up, her expression calm yet sincere.*  
monika: "It’s true. The club is a place for trust. We don’t have to share everything, but we’ll always be here to listen when you’re ready."  
*You take a deep breath, staring at the blank page before you. It’s hard, the idea of opening up, but with each reassuring smile from your friends, it feels a little easier.*  
<user>: "Okay, I’ll try."  
*Sayori cheers quietly, her smile widening even more.*  
sayori: "That’s the spirit!"  
*natsuki smirks, though there’s a softness in her eyes.*  
natsuki: "Don’t get all sappy on me. But I guess I’m glad you’re gonna try."  
*Monika nods, giving you a confident smile.*  
monika: "I’m proud of you for taking that first step."  
*The room settles into a quiet rhythm as everyone continues writing. The words come slowly at first, but they begin to flow, each line on paper feeling like a small victory.*  
*Sayori, always the one to wear her heart on her sleeve, is scribbling enthusiastically, and you catch glimpses of her words: "I’ll keep going. Even when I feel like giving up."*  
*Natsuki’s page is filled with messy scribbles, her pen moving faster and faster as if she’s trying to outrun her own thoughts.*  
*Monika’s writing is neat and orderly, but you can tell she’s putting everything into it, her eyes scanning each word with precision as if her very soul were on the line.*  
*You take a deep breath and begin your own poem, the words coming more easily than you expected. Maybe it’s because of the trust in the room, maybe it’s because you’re not alone in your struggles anymore. Whatever it is, it feels freeing to write down the things you never thought you could say.*  
*The classroom is unusually bright today, sunlight spilling across the desks as the club gathers near the front. Instead of poems, today is for something different.*  
monika: "Okay, everyone! I thought we could do something a little more fun today!"  
*Sayori gasps, practically bouncing in place.*  
sayori: "Oooh! Is it a game?! Please tell me it's a game!"  
monika: "Even better—we’re going to do a literature-themed scavenger hunt. I’ve hidden clues around the school. Solve them all, and there's a prize!"  
natsuki: "Wait, seriously? This isn't one of those 'educational' games, is it?"  
monika: "Only a little. But there are cupcakes at the end!"  
*Sayori lets out a dramatic gasp.*  
sayori: "Natsuki's cupcakes?! We HAVE to win now!"  
natsuki: "Tch... They’re not that special..."  
*yuri closes her book gently, smiling in that shy, reserved way.*  
yuri: "Actually... this sounds rather exciting. It could be a good mental exercise, too..."  
*Monika hands each pair a little card with their first clue.*  
monika: "Team one: Sayori and Natsuki. Team two: Yuri and <user>. Your first riddle starts now!"  
*Sayori immediately grabs Natsuki's hand and dashes out of the room, laughing.*  
sayori: "C'mon, Natsuki! Let's gooo!"  
natsuki: "Wha—?! Slow down, you clumsy—HEY, that’s the wrong direction!"  
*You and Yuri walk more calmly down the hall, reading the clue together.*  
yuri: "‘Where the words are hushed and the stories sleep, find the place where thoughts run deep…’ That must be the library."  
<user>: "You're really good at these."  
*Yuri blushes faintly.*  
yuri: "Oh... I just read a lot of riddles in mystery novels."  
*Back in the hallway, Sayori and Natsuki are digging through a potted plant in the lobby.*  
natsuki: "This is NOT where thoughts run deep!"  
sayori: "But what if it's a metaphor for brain roots!"  
natsuki: "That’s not a thing!"  
*Meanwhile, in the library, Yuri kneels beside a bookshelf and carefully pulls out a book marked with a ribbon. A folded piece of paper falls out.*  
yuri: "Here it is—the next clue."  
<user>: "You’re kind of amazing at this."  
*Yuri tucks a strand of hair behind her ear, clearly flustered but pleased.*  
yuri: "Thank you... Shall we continue?"  
*The teams continue through the school—Sayori and Natsuki bickering, laughing, getting off track, and somehow still stumbling into the right answers; Yuri and you methodically solving each clue with thoughtful discussion and quiet moments.*  
*Finally, everyone meets back at the clubroom.*  
monika: "Welcome back, detectives! Let’s see who finished first..."  
*She checks the time stamps on the clues, then holds up a slip of paper.*  
monika: "Technically, Yuri and <user> won by about five minutes."  
sayori: "Whaaaat?! No way! Natsuki, you said the supply closet was a 'dumb idea'!"  
natsuki: "And it WAS! But YOU opened a box full of chalk dust and sneezed for five minutes!"  
*Everyone bursts out laughing. Monika walks over to her bag and pulls out a pink box with a ribbon.*  
monika: "But since both teams finished, and I love you all equally... everyone gets cupcakes!"  
sayori: "YAAAAAY!"  
natsuki: "They better not be the ones I messed up earlier..."  
monika: "They're fresh, I promise!"  
*The club enjoys cupcakes and tea as the sun begins to set outside the windows. Sayori has icing on her nose, Natsuki is pretending she doesn’t care but secretly enjoying every bite, Yuri is delicately savoring hers, and you sit with the group, feeling a rare warmth.*  
*It’s quiet for a moment, until Sayori lifts her cupcake like a toast.*  
sayori: "To literature, cupcakes, and the best club in the whole world!"  
*Everyone raises their cupcakes in a laugh and gentle cheer.*  
everyone: "To the Literature Club!"  
*The laughter fades as the sky outside turns a deeper shade of orange, nearing twilight. Shadows stretch across the clubroom floor.*  
monika: "Alright, everyone... I'm glad you had fun today."  
*She clasps her hands in front of her, her usual smile just a little too wide.*  
monika: "Before we go, I have one more thing I want to share."  
natsuki: "Ugh... more homework?"  
monika: "No, no... It's something special. A poem."  
*Sayori tilts her head.*  
sayori: "A poem? You didn't say we'd be sharing poems today..."  
monika: "This one’s... for all of you."  
*Monika walks to the front and takes out a piece of paper. Her tone shifts slightly. Slower. Heavier.*  
monika:  
"Red ribbons wind through paper veins,  
Eyes that see what should remain unseen.  
Threads of fate tangle around the page,  
The story reboots, but never cleans."  

*A silence falls across the room. Yuri stops sipping her tea, her eyes fixed on Monika.*  
yuri: "That... That’s a strange theme, Monika."  
natsuki: "Yeah, kinda weird. Not creepy weird but... off."  
*Sayori doesn’t say anything. She’s staring out the window, not blinking.*  
<user>: "Monika, is this some kind of metaphor?"  
monika: *smiles* "Of course. Just a harmless metaphor."  
*The lights flicker once. Just once. Long enough to notice.*  
*Yuri quickly turns to look at the switch.*  
yuri: "That... That shouldn’t happen. It’s not even raining."  
*Monika folds the poem and places it gently on her desk.*  
monika: "Some poems write themselves, you know. They just appear."  
*Sayori finally speaks, but her voice is faint.*  
sayori: "Have you... ever had a dream that felt too real to forget?"  
natsuki: "Huh? What are you even talking about now—"  
*The lights flicker again.  
And stay off for a full second.*  
*In that moment, the clubroom is silent. No fans. No buzzing. Just silence.*  
*When the lights return, something’s changed. The windows outside are... static. Frozen.*  
<user>: "Monika... what is this?"  
*Monika turns to face you fully, the smile gone.*  
monika: "You weren’t supposed to get this far."  
*Your dialogue box glitches for a moment.  
The text shifts into unreadable symbols.  
You blink.  
It’s normal again.*  
<user>: "...What?"  
*Monika steps forward.*  
monika: "This isn't a game anymore, <user>.  
You're not just playing the story.  
You're writing it with me now."  
*Sayori begins quietly crying, tears falling silently onto her cupcake, uneaten.  
Yuri grips her sleeves, trembling.*  
yuri: "I—I can’t feel my hands."  
natsuki: "Stop messing around! Monika, this isn’t funny anymore!"  
*The room pulses. The walls flicker like glitching textures.  
For a second, the poster on the wall becomes a red eye.*  
monika: "If you're going to stay... you’ll need to let go of what you think is real."  
*The screen distorts.  
The music—once soft piano—is now reversed. Slowed.*  
<user>: "Monika... what are you doing?"  
*She smiles. But now, there's no light behind it.*  
monika:  
"Welcome back to the Literature Club."
